It is just the beginning of the application of science to food production and will rank with the invention of farming in world history. It could be so. Should we count on it and plan accordingly?  Norman I-orlaug, the most prominent of the \"\"green revolutionists\"\" and certainly one of the most optimistic, says no. He has stated repeatedly that he and his fellow agriculturalists are \"\"buying\"\" the world 15 years or so in which to do something about rapid population growth. And Eorlaug is as optimnstic as anybody about the chances of extending high-yield wheat cultivation to semi-arid north Africa, or to the cold^ dry Anatolian Plateau where Russian Besostaya is preferable to Mexican varieties, or new rices like a recent Thai release to submerged, flood plains. There is ample scope for extension of the \"\"green revolution\"\", but its extension somehow looks less inexorable than forecast demographic trends.  Who v/ill win the food-population race we cannot now guess. Like pushing against a large wall, worying about it takes energy, but produces no work because the mass is not moved. It would be m.ore useful to cncentrate on m.asses we can move: achieving a level of human population we would ^yant to live with; breeding better grains for more varied conditions; improving our cultivation of pulses and vegetables; seeking alternatives for farmers during technical transition; figuring out bow to employ the people our 15-year breathing space have given us; devising a rational mechanization policy. , . .

STERBA  Special to The New York Times  LOS BANOS, the Philippines \"\"The Green Revolution, launched seven years ago with freat hope for vanquishing Hunger, is sputtering along as little more than a minor revolt as Asia, overpopulated and undernourished, continues the struggle to feed itself.  The joy that accompanied the development of \"\"miracle\"\" rice and wheat seed in the mid-nineteen sixties has been tempered by skepticism and disillusionment as famine continues to stalk poor regions.  The myriad progress reports and success stories are real, but so is a host of complex secondary problems. The revolutionary seeds, and the technology that goes with them, still hold the potential for rad-' ically improving the lives of hundreds of millions of impov-' erished Asians, but that poten-tial remains substantially un-, realized.  r The small gains in food productivity in underdeveloped countries over two decades \"\"including the recent Green -Revolution years  have been largely wiped out by population growth. At the same time, the spread of high-yield plants has yet to have a significant impact on production in Asia, where 90 per cent of the world's rice is grown and eaten. In fact, charts plotting production since World War II offer little evidence that a Green Revolution exists.  ' 10 Per Cent in High-Yield Rice  In non-Communist Asia more than 25 million acres are planted yearly with high-yield rice, which amounts to less than 10 per cent of rice acreage there.  Those farmers who switcheli to high-yield varieties have often found that output has not increased much if at all because they have not been able to take full advantage of the new technology.  Furthermore, the Green Revolution has contributed to widening the gap between rich End poor farmers because those able to risk more for the 'required fertilizer, insecticide and water have prospered. The poor farmer, living from crop . to crop, cannot afford the add- ed costs without credit, which ; is expensive, if available at all.  The ^ Philippines and India, pioneers in switching to high- yield seed, pronounced them-' selves self - sufficient in food grains in 1970 and 1972, respectively. This year, after drought and flood, India Is suffering another famine and the Philippines has a rice shortage that threatens economic stability. \"\"   THE NEW YORK TIM^S, SUNDAY. APRIL IS. 1973  '' In two years a drought that!  has stretched from the Soviet' ^ Union to Australia has made a . mockery of predictions of food surpluses.  Great Potential for Uplift  i\"\" Development experts say that no single achievement . since the postwar conquest of i malaria holds more potential for human uplift than the ..breakthrough in breeding high-^yield grain for tropical areas. -A technological or social ^ breakthrough to curb popula-Rtion growth would overshadow ^both developments, but popu-Hation control in most of the f underdeveloped world remains , largely a wish or a hope. ^ The Green Revolution, simple in concept, means modernizing agriculture by getting more yield out of land. Rich \"\"countries like the United States, with temperate cli-\"\"fnates, began to do this at the -turn of the century. Poor tropical countries are just beginning. If they wanted to grow piore in the past they simply planted more on more land,  jRqj puB[ l(DnUI OS uo UMBjp  8Ei( q;Moj3 uotjBindod jnq 'this is no longer possible for the most part.  What was needed was new seed, because the usual seed did not yield more when fertilizer was added. New seeds for wheat and rice were developed in the nineteen-sixties at .two research centers 'spon-'sored by American foundations.  First, from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center in El Batan' Texococo, Mexico, came miracle wheat. One of its chief developers, Dr. Norman E. Borlaug, was awarded a Nobel Prize foi; his efforts. Next, from the International Rice Research Institute in Los Banos, the Philippines, came miracle rice.  The program had been a long time in coming. In the late eighteen hundreds Japan started experimenting with fertilizer to increase rice output. Of the hundreds of temperate-climate rice varieties grown there, only tl-.e relatively short, erect, stiff-stemmed ones yielded more. These so-called dwarf strains were selected by farmers over generations.  In more recent times fertilizeri was tried on tropical varieties! that are taller and droopier, but' it did not work.   r,_,  Tipped Too Readily  Yield is directly related to the amount of sun the plants soak up before they tip over. Or lodge, before harvest. The fertilizer made tropical plants ^w even taller, wifich meant that the stems tipped more easily, especially in bad weather.  What was needed was a plant With a short, stiff stem that would not tip after fertilizer was applied.  Only Japan felt the need, turning to occtipied Taiwan to increase production to feed the homeland. But Taiwan's subtropical varieties would not respond to fertilizer, so the Japanese used seed from home that'  /  ..y    0   ^'.ij  1'      ,fc,ieTEC&-"},{"id":"p16022coll345:69317","object":"https://cdm16022.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/getthumbnail/collection/p16022coll345/id/69317","set_spec":"p16022coll345","collection_name":"Norman E.

Borlaug, who helped to develop miracle wheat.  was adapted to local conditions in the nineteen-twenties.  After World War II, when the Chinese regained control of Taiwan, an agricultural improvement station in Taichung started crossing subtropical varieties with a cross based on Japanese strains. By 1956 they had one that produced 50 per cent higher yields. But only a few peopl^ knew about it.  In the nineteen-fifties the Rockefeller and Ford Founda-jtions teamed up to split the 1 costs of rice research based in Asia, selecting the College of Agriculture at the University of the Philippines at Los Banos. They rented 200 acres for a token peso a year.  Aim: A Tropical Dwarf  The International Rice Research Institute opened in February, 1962, with an international staff, including scientists from seven countries. Its main aim was to increase tropical rice production by breeding a variety that would respond properly to fertilizera tropical dwarf.  T. T. Chang, the institute's geneticist from Taiwan, suggested starting with three Taiwanese semi-dwarfs.  The first year 38 crosses were made. The most successful, combining a Taiwanese cross and a disease-resistant Indonesian variety, produced in 1966 what came to be known as miracle rice. It is one of a number of varieties developed for the special conditions of various countries.  While Asian varieties produced about 1.5 metric tons a hectare (2.47 acres) generation after generation, the new one produced more than 6 tons on experimental plots. Shorter and stiffer-stemmed, it has more shoots per seed and its leaves grow more upright, catching more sun.  Apart from production problems, the first miracle rice did' not taste good to many Asians because its chubby, chalky grains contain too much starch. The taste difference is similar to that; between regular and hot-house tomatoes.  The new seed did not promise instant plenty. However, it provedin the face of wide iDelief to the contrarythat tropical yields could be increased.  Wide Use of New Wheat  Miracle wheat spread the fastest. In Asia 20 per cent of the wheat areas are planted with the new seed yearly, as j compared with roughly 9 per cent in new rice.  A main reason for the slow progress with the new rice is that most rice farmers live where environmental conditions are the most unpredictable too many floods and droughts, too many insects and plant diseases.  Miracle rice grows best and yields most in ideal conditions, with controllable year-round irrigation. But two-thirds of the Asian rice land is dependent I on rain; only about 25 per  cent is irrigated, and only a i small fraction of that is irri-! gated under conditions that; j guarantee a year-round supply.-I Environmental conditions are lonly one limiting factor in the ! Green Revolution. Four years !ago Dr. Clifton R. Wharton Jr., I now president of Michigan I State University, called attention to its possible paradoxes, j \"\"On the one hand,\"\" he wrote 'in Foreign Affairs, \"\"some ob-I servers now believe that the jrace between food and popu-jlation is over, that victory is iin sight in the war on hunger, i Others see this development as ! opening a Pandora's box; its very success will produce  a number of new problems which are far more subtle and diffi-icult than those faced during the development of the new technology.\"\"  Dr. Wharton cited marketing, storage and transport, and  supplies of fertilizer and pesticideall problems not faced in growing traditional rice.  \"\"If only a small fraction of the rural population moves into the modern century while the bulk remains behind, or perhaps even goes backward, the situation will be highly explosive,\"\" he added.  A year later Wolf Ladejinsky, a World Bank official, writing on the first five years of India's Green Revolution, said many of the problems were already a reality.  \"\"An Indian village reflects a power structure very much biased in favor of the affluent,\"\" he said, adding;  \"\"Now that Green Revolution land is practically invaluable (sometimes quadrupling in value), the owners would like to get -rid of tenants altogether and resume the land for self-' cultivation, making use of the plentiful supply of hired labor which has no claims on the land whatsoever.  'The Old Squeeze'  . \"\"There are too many tenants or sharecroppers to deal with them summarily without courting a good deal of trouble, but the old squeeze whereby tenants are reduced to sharecroppers and eventually to landless workers is being accelerated as more of the bigger owners be-comfe involved with the new I technology.\"\"   Many of the problems are shared throughout the poor rice-growing countries of Asia. Being ' social and political, they are much more complicated to deal with than the development of seed.  D. L. Umaii, a director of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, commented;  \"\"The removal of the constraints and the ultimate solu-  tion of the problems of the rice industry will depend on the political will of national leaders to see that enlightened policies are formulated and implemented.\"\"  The lack of such policies has handicapped the underdeveloped world since newly independent nations began their quest for betterment after World War II. As population continues its largely unchecked growth, many of the social problems are becoming increasingly difficult to solve. The Green Revolution, some experts believe, may be overwhelmed by the very problems  the chief culprit being population growth  it might have solved.  \"\"While changes in world production kept pace with population growth, yield changes were not staying abreast of population increases in many developing countries,\"\" wrote Randolph Barker and Don Winkelmann, agriculture economists with the rice and wheat reasearch centers. Nevertheless, both are optimistic that the high-yield seed will continue to spread and be improved and that .social conditions can be changed by the new technology.  Robert F. Chandler Jr., until recently director of the Los Banos Instittue, said the new seed and technology . had brought great hope.  \"\"Rice research workers and extension people in many countries have completely revised their attitudes toward the future.\"\" he said. \"\"New goals of yield and production have been revealed to them. Many now see that the tropics offers the planet's greatest untapped ^resource for feeding mankind.\"\"  The associate director, D.S. Athwal, put it a more sobering way; \"\"What we are saying is either you apply the new technology or you starve.\"\""},{"id":"p16022coll345:69316","object":"https://cdm16022.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/getthumbnail/collection/p16022coll345/id/69316","set_spec":"p16022coll345","collection_name":"Norman E.

India with 560 or 570 million people has staggering food problems. Right now, she is undergoing another devastating drought such as the United States has not known since the \"\"Dust Bowl\"\" days of the early 1930's. NonethelesB, India's food grain production this crop year will top 110 million short tons, a third more than was produced in 1966-67, which happens to have been both a drought year and the year when the high-yielding hybrid seeds were first widely distributed.

As part of a recent three-week tour of India, I traveled about 600 miles through the wheat-growing sections of the north, an area I know well but had not visited in more than 10 years. Mile after mile of fields of brilliant green lined the roads--wheat planted in October and November of last year and now being harvested. The thickness of the growth and the heavy heads of grain were a sight that would have delighted a Kansas farmer and one that I, who lived in India for seven years> firankly never expected to see.  Although the wheat harvest is not yet finished, it is estimated that this year's crop will be about 33 million tons, a 13 per cent increase over last year's and 175 per cent more than in 1966. In the Punjab state alone, production has gone from 2 million tons in 1966--before widespread use of hybrids--to an estimated 6.5 million tons this year.  The success of the \"\"miracle seeds\"\" developed in Mexico by Dr. N.E. Borlaug of the Rockefeller Foundation, who won a Nobel Prize for his achievement, has spread their cultivation into other areas of the country where it was never grown before and has helped in some degree to meet the skyrocketing needs of the growing population. But the introduction of the \"\"miracle seeds\"\" alone did not produce the sudden burst of production. A lot of education and persuasion was needed to bring conservative farmers around to new ways. Fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation, farm equipment and extension services had to be provided. The Mexican strains had to be further improved to adapt them to Indian growing conditions and even to Indian tastes. And a lot of hard work had to be done by the farmers themselves, for the new seeds require intensive cultivation to produce maximum, results.  On my last trip I visited the 10-acre farm of Jaswant Singh near Samrala, about 175 miles north of New Delhi, where I learned about the factors that have produced what truly can be called a \"\"wheat revolution\"\".  Jaswant, like virtually all of his neighbors, is a Sikh--bearded and turbaned as his religion requires and robust like most Punjabis. He came to Samrala from the West Punjab, now a part of Pakistan and formerly the wheat basket of the subcontinent, during the terrible days that followed the partition of British India in 1947. The land he holds was given to him by the government to replace ancestral holdings his father had lost to Pakistan.  Last year, Jaswant harvested a wheat crop of 1, 450 bushels which he sold for about Rs. 30, 000 ($4,000). That's not much of a gross by American farming standards, nor was his net of about $2, 000, but considering he earned less than a quarter as much seven years ago he is newly \"\"afluent\"\" as are about half or more of his fellow Punjabi wheat farmers.

Some journalists and others too, even some FAC planners, did contrive to see the dawn of the millenium in the \"\"green revolution\"\", however.  To a limited extent, one could argue that the \"\"green revolution\"\" was a bit over-sold by some of i'3 proponents, like the Rockefeller Foundation, Much more important has been its \"\"overbuying\"\". Back in 1967, Phillippine sociologist Gelia Castillo wrote devastatingly an accurately about \"\"'Miracle Rice' as Produced by the Press. \"\" Now, following a coincidence of droughts and floods, the cver-buyers are turning superbears again. It's a good time to pause, to ask what happened, who benefitted, and if possible, where it all leads.  ^VHAT HAPPENED Until about a century ago, virtually all humans  could afford to be casual about the amount of food mostly grains they got from a unit of farm land. The exceptions to low-yields were peculiar circumstances where nature or enemies obliged a lot of people to live with the little farm land, e.g., Egypt. Then, in Europe, the Industrial Revolution brought falling death rates, booming population, and, despite massive emigrations, the need to improve agricultural land use. Better techniques were discussed and applied. Crop yields per hectare increased steadily in Europe and the other \"\"Part I\"\" countries, and in the richer centrally-planned economies as well. We cna call it the spread of \"\"scientific\"\" agriculture wothout knowing just what that means.  The poor countries remained in the pattern of low grain yields. The colonial era introduced \"\"scientific\"\" growing of some export crops. Late in that era, major advances in public health lowered the death rate. The birth rate and the organization of production, however, remained substantially unchanged. Population was growing rapidly, but crop yields were not, and supplies of farm land were limited. Thence, the apparent Malthusian trap of the mid-1960's.  For some densely populated places, like Java, Egypt or Haiti, the trap seemed to have sprung already. Moreover, it was not easy for them to solve the dilema the way Britain did. The more serious concern, however, was that the world as a whole would run out of farm leind, while the econom-ies of two-thirds of the people were unable to keep up with population grov/th either through higher crop yields or through industrial exports.  This pattern and these fears are familiar enough. So, for some, is the story of how a major dent was hammered into the pattern of the poor countries' low grain yields. The Rockefeller Foundation agricultural scientists went to work in Mexico in 1943. Norman Borlaug and his tea of trigueros were dedicated, and they had all the resources they needed, prestige, and access to the M^inister -all enough to make the M^exicans who had preceded them in the field justifiable envious. By 1948, they were releasing new seeds. A constant succession of new varieties has contained the stem-rust problem, allowed for use of more fertilizer, and quadrupled Mexico's wheat yields. Mexico used to have to subsidize wheat farmers and still to import wheat. Through improved techniques, average wheat production costs have been halved, and almost all of this technical windfall now finds its way to the consumer. Cheaper bread means, among other things, cheaper labor costs for industry.  It was not apparent that other poor countries could achieve Mexican results for wheat or anything","page_count":0,"record_type":"secondary","parent_id":"p16022coll345:69542","first_viewer_type":"image","viewer_type":"image","child_index":95,"attachment":"69290.jp2","document_type":"item","featured_collection_order":999,"date_added":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","date_added_sort":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","date_modified":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"p16022coll345:69288","object":"https://cdm16022.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/getthumbnail/collection/p16022coll345/id/69288","set_spec":"p16022coll345","collection_name":"Norman E.

Under the duress of drought and threatned famine in 1965, India and Pakistan decided to take the gamble. It paid off By 1971, farmers had switched between 40% and 50% of the wheat lands in both countries to Mexican-derived varieties. Problems of local adaptation had been met; no miracle disease had annihilated the new wheats. These new wheats occupied the better farmlands, were first adopted by the better farmers, and intrinsically have better genetic potential; in India and Pakistan, they provided better than half the wheat -probably about two-thirds- by 1971.  Mexican wheats have now made inroads from Morocco to China, though nowhere is the switch over as considerable as in Pakistan and India. Too deep a winter frost in highland Turkey and too little water in north Africa have proved to be diffusion barriers. Still, of the poor contries' wheat lands, if we exclude the Peoples' Republic of China (no figures) and Argentina (more like a Part I country for wheat) roughly one-fifth is sown to Mexican wheats.  THE TURN TO RICE  Founding the International Rice Research Institute in 1962 represented an effort to bring off similar changes for rice. The IRRI and other new high-yielding rices began to have a farm level impact in 1965-66 and now occupy over half the Philippines' rice land. Simultaneously, they have spread to other countries, chiefly in south and southeast Asia. As with the new wheats, India accounts for roughly half the area planted, but Cuba may well be the country the most completely switched over to these new rices.  The new rices are younger than the new wheats. Their international spi*ead has beeii more rapid, and problems of local adaptation and consumer acceptance have accompanied it.  Even in the Philippines, a tungrovirus epidemic hit the 1971 crop, affecting traditiohal and many improved rices as well. Mexico had its last wheat stem-rust epidemic a full 11 years after the Rockefeller Program began releasing wheats, however. Perhaps continued breeding and adaptive research will solve some of the new rices' problems. And, even now, excluding China, new Philippine rices and their close relatives cover about one-tenth of the Part 11 countries' rice land.  There is no comparable revolution for man's next most important grains -maize and sorghum. The kernel of a maize revolution may be germinating in east Africa; Kenya's Kitale hybrids now cover one-fourth of Kenya's maize land and are spreading rapidly both there and in Ethiopia, Uganda and Tanzania. Countries as diverse as Brazil and Thailand are experiencing success with synthetic maize. These developments are embryonic compared to wheat and rice though, and the lack of a break-through for sorghum - so well adapted to much of the world's drier lands - is disappointing.  TOO BENEFITS  Several million wheat and rice farmers have adopted the new, high-yielding varieties. (The number of Kitale maize adopters is in the order of magnitude of 50, 000,) That all these independent and canny decision-m.akers are doing the same thing suggests that there is something in it for them. It's highly unlikely that they have been acting out of sheer patriotism or devotion to plan directives.","page_count":0,"record_type":"secondary","parent_id":"p16022coll345:69542","first_viewer_type":"image","viewer_type":"image","child_index":96,"attachment":"69291.jp2","document_type":"item","featured_collection_order":999,"date_added":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","date_added_sort":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","date_modified":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"p16022coll345:69291","object":"https://cdm16022.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/getthumbnail/collection/p16022coll345/id/69291","set_spec":"p16022coll345","collection_name":"Norman E.

What is profitable for certain farmers is not necessarily profitable for societies. And then, farmers may be forced to adopt a switch, as were Mexican what farmers may not be the only or even the principal benefitters. In Mexico, after a short time, the consumers were, but a large slice of te grains might go to land owners, to fertilizer, chemical or machinery providers, to the government, even to middlemen of farm workers. And, which farmers get that farmers' share? And what happens to farmers, even to regions that cannot adopt the new techniques with profit? And finally, what does it all mean for international trade and balance-of-payments problems?  Most of these questions have no universal answers valid for all countries where the grains are catching on. Let me sum up the general observations that can be made briefly.  TRADE  To take the last point first, a general answer is easiest to make regarding trade. The \"\"green revolution's\"\" technical changes improve the competitive position of tropical producers with good water control, in the rice case, and the sub-tropical producers for wheat. Unit production costs really are lowered. V/e have seen that Mexico can now almost compete with the American Plains. The change is not so complete in other cotintries and cost reductions have been less than the Mexican halving. India is still paying the farmer ca. $100 per ton at the official exchange rate and ca. $75 at an equilibrium one. But the changes are continuing, and other countires are likely to experience Mexico-like effects-  So far the \"\"green revolution\"\" has occurred exclusively in grain-importing countries. Cutting costs means making their producers better able to complete with imports, hence eroding world-trade demand and narrowing trade. It takes some cheek to stress that effect this year, when floods have hurt rice crops in the Philippines and Indonesia, drought has reduced them from Pakistan through Burma, and Russia, India and Chiiia are suddenly buying up all avai lable v/heat too. Years like this notwithstanding, the ''green revolution's\"\" effect is to lower the price an effect which rice exporters in Thailand, Burma and China were only too aware ci betv/een 1968 ind now. Cther things being equal, which we can see they are not, especially this year, poor countries that have been able to put the new varieties to. work are closer to self-sufficiency. We can even expect to see a few of them turn to marginal exporters in good years, as Mexico has, though it seems unlikely that their cost structures will let them be consistent exporters. And these countries can hardly afford to dump grain exports at a loss, as certain rich countries unfortunately do.  The effects on adopters and non-adopters, on leaders and laggers, within cotintries is more ticklish.  REGIONAL EFFECTS  Regional effects are easiest to comment on. In Mexico, wheat production has disappeared from the high, narrow valleys of Michoacan; it is concent'.'ated on broad, irrigated lands, especially in the northwest. Mexican wheats thrive on proper watering, good land preparation and proper seeding depth. \"\"^AHiere water is scarce of good land preparation and seeding are difficult (e.g. hilly land which precludes using a drill seeder), new wheats are less attractive.","page_count":0,"record_type":"secondary","parent_id":"p16022coll345:69542","first_viewer_type":"image","viewer_type":"image","child_index":97,"attachment":"69292.jp2","document_type":"item","featured_collection_order":999,"date_added":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","date_added_sort":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","date_modified":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"p16022coll345:69292","object":"https://cdm16022.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/getthumbnail/collection/p16022coll345/id/69292","set_spec":"p16022coll345","collection_name":"Norman E.

A farm.er can change the way he farms, including the amount of fertilizer he applies, but he cannot make it rain or make the rough places plain.  The nev/ rices are fussy about natural conditions too. Like the wheats, they are superior over -a wide range of conditions. One frequently hears that the new wheats, rices, and hybrid m.aize too, are delicate plants requiring sophisticated management. In fact, they are remarkably hardy. Yet no variety is adapted to the c-ntire range of conditions where each grain grows. The new rices need plenty of water, but also will not tolerate deep flooding. This makes them useless for mapy areas with poor water control, whether from counting on rainfall or from, uncontrolled, deep flooding.  What happens to the areas that cannot profitably adopt the new varieties? If the by-passed zones are in a country struggling to replace imports, the producers' grain price is probably determined by the world market plus whatever margin of protection is accorded. By-passed areas will not be squeezed out, but will miss out on the technical windfall.  Once imports from Thailand or Kansas are replaced, local prices tend to be set by local supply conditions. So far, this situation has been reached only for Mexican wheat. If that is any guide as it probably is, then real farm prices will decline. Those who cannot adopt the new techniques profitably will be squeezed.  The Philippines, India, Pakistan, Kenya and others may now be coming into the self-sufficiency range, a likelihood not to be obscured by this year's floods and droughts. If so, the same squeeze that squoze wheat farmers with sub-optimal land in Mexico's mesa central will be felt by Philippine rice farmers without irrigation, by wheat farmers without irrigation, by wheat farmers in drier M^adhaya Pradesh, and by Kenyan maize farmers on the Luo Plain.  Governments and researchers need to be working hard on crops for these farmersprincipally in semi-arid areasto switch to. Unless the by-passed are quickly provided with profitable alternatives, the \"\"green revolution\"\" will mean their dislocation or deeper poverty.  LEADERS AND LAGGERS  Even in favored areas, there are leaders and laggers. Some farmers are quicker to spot a profitable nev/ technique than others, and quicker to jump on the bandwagon. Invariably, these tend to be the more cosmopolitan, the more travelled, those closer to markets, also the richer and those farming bigger farms.  Much misleading reportage on the \"\"green revolution\"\" stems from taking a snapshot of a situation where leaders have led and laggers are still vacillating. Such a photograph is revealing, but it will not tell us the final result of a process still in motion at the moment of snapping.  The richer farmera-with bigger farms are disproportionate benefitters in the early stages of any profitable change in technique. Progressive farmers do obtain an early edge by adopting new rices, wheats, or maize too. Observing this has lead many observers to conclude that the green revolution\"\" is turning red, or tha.t the rich are getting richer and the poor poorer, etc.","page_count":0,"record_type":"secondary","parent_id":"p16022coll345:69542","first_viewer_type":"image","viewer_type":"image","child_index":98,"attachment":"69293.jp2","document_type":"item","featured_collection_order":999,"date_added":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","date_added_sort":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","date_modified":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"p16022coll345:69294","object":"https://cdm16022.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/getthumbnail/collection/p16022coll345/id/69294","set_spec":"p16022coll345","collection_name":"Norman E.

But again, these national policies were not part of a world pattern of farmer exploitation. Other governments, like Pakistan, bent the other way to subsidize farmers' use of fertilizer and machinery.  Middlemen, frequently perceived as running off with the windfall, can do so only if they can collude to extract monopoly profits. Evidence suggests that, for grain, they rarely succeed in doing this. The buyer most likely to establish a m_onopoly to the detriment of the farmer is the government, but worry about the World Food Problem and the import bill has usually made governments chary of doing this of late.  THE LABOR PUZZLE  Finally, the benefits to labor are a hot issue. Some scholars have noticed that intensification of grain-growing has driven northwest Mexico, and around IRR,I in the Philippines. It has. So has the wage probably fallen in by-passed regions.  All in all, the new seeds lower the labor componentrequire less labor per ton of grain. Comparing new varieties and old ones with similar techniques, the diminution seems to be ca. 25% for whea.t in Ethiopia, 25% for rice in the Philippines and possibly 40% for maize in Kenya.  When accompanying changes in techniques are thrown in, the labor-component reduction may be greater; Mexican mechanized, rationalized wheat production now requires 10-15% of the labor per ton that it did 20 years ago.  That the \"\"green revolution\"\" is labor-saving (i.e., job destroying) does not mean that we ought to turn back the clock. For one thing, labor sabing looks different depending on whether you can replace other people's jobs (grain imports) or whether it's your own. For another thing, we haven't measured its effects on non-farm employment in fertilizer factories, tool-repair shops, wine-and-spirits shops, and more industrial employment as a result of lower food costs.  We must also be careful to separate effects of new seeds from those of mechanization, which often accompanies it but need not. Tractorization is subsidized in many countries through cheap imports and cheap credit (some from the Bank). Countries and lenders which are also spending a lot of money to cope with unemployment are beginning to take a hard look at these policies. Perhaps, in such circumstances, labor-intensive farming techniques should be given a free hand (or more) in competing with capital-intensive ones, but only careful economic analysis can give the right answer.  WHERE DOES IT ALL LEAD?  The most honest answer to our third question is that we don't know. We simply can't say \"\"who will win the food-population race. \"\" At first glance, it looks as though continuation of present demographic trends leads to absurd situationspeople standing on each other's head and what not. That way, the World Population Problem would be solved all rightby rising death rates.  But then, it is just conceivable that food scientists will come up with a new break-through just in time we seem to be running out of food.

It is just the beginning of the application of science to food production and will rank with the invention of farming in world history. It could be so. Should we count on it and plan accordingly?  Norman Torlaug, the most prominent of the \"\"green revolutionists\"\" and certainly one of the most optimistic^ says no. He has stated repeatedly that he and his fellow agriculturalists are \"\"buying\"\" the world 15 years or so in which to do something about rapid population growth. And Borlaug is as optimistic as anybody about the chances of extending high-yield wheat cultivation to semi-arid norch Africa, or to the cold, dry Anatolian Plateau where Russian Besostaya is preferable to Mexican varieties, or new rices like a recent Thai release to submerged, flood plains. There is ample scope for extension of the \"\"green revolution\"\", but its extension somehow looks less inexorable than forecast demographic trends.  ^Vho will win the food-population race we cannot now guess. Like pushing against a large wall, worying about it takes energy, but produces no work because the mass is not moved. It would be more useful to cncentrate on masses we can move: achieving a level of human population we wotild want to live with; breeding better grains for more varied conditions; improving our cultivation of pulses and vegetables; seeking alternatives for farmers during technical transition; figuring out how to employ the people our 15-year breathing space have given us; devising a rational mechanization policy.,. .

CONSTRUCTION OF CIMMYT'S CIMMYT's swimming pool, which was  SWIMMING POOL FINISHED constructed with the idea of making available  more sports facilities for use by the trainees, as well as those living at El Batdn, was finished last Wednesday, March 7, after  approximately 5 months of work.  The swimming pool measures 10. OQ by 14.00 meters, with a maximum depth of 2.50 meters, and a volume of water of 220 m^. It has a filtering and heating system, and the water has chlorine in it. The pool has a small diving board and underwater lighting. There is also a bar for selling refreshments.  There is also a small pool for children with a depth of 50 to 70 centim.eters. Over the children's pool is a pavilion of lattice-work to give some shade to the area.  Over the machine house, shower rooms and dressing rooms for men and women are available.  Initially, the swimming pool will be for the exclusive use of the residents of the dormitories, apartments and guest house. For the present time, the use of the swim.ming pool by friends and relatives living outside El Batan is strictly prohibited.  All children under 10 years of age must be accompanied by an adult. There must be at least ? persons using the pool at any one time, in case help is needed in an emergency.

On this point, lessons of experience are mixed. The mixed results are not produced by the new seeds, which can be grown by the smallest, poorest farmer he can be groAvn by the smallest, poorest farmer if he csin get land, water, and perhaps, credit 'til harvest to permit fertilizer use. The institutional frameworks into which the new seeds are being introduced vary widely however. They may enable the large, progressive farmer to deprive his neighbors of the requisites to benefit from the new seeds; they may not.  //e can't exhaust this issue here. Access to land is paramount though. If a small number of privileged farmers are allowed to control a country's prime farm land, the \"\"green revolution's\"\" impact is predictable. If tenants occupy such land but have no security of tenure, progressive farmers and landlords will probably displace them between the lead and the lag.  Such is frequently not the case, however. Mexico and Keny^ have had recent land reforms; small farmers occupy a significant part of the prime land and cannot easily be put off it. They marginally less efficient than bigger farmers, but they are benefitting from the new grains.  So are small Philippine farmers, many of them share tenants (until this year anyhow). Their position has been protected by traditional ties, possission of guns, and, increasingly, governmental support, and evictions have been rare. Landlords benefit from share arrangements as productivity rises, but they also assum.e some costs and risks. Ironically, many Philippine tenants, switched to fixed rents under a government program, found themselves cut off from credit and less able to adopt innovations.  Not all experiences have been so relatively felicitous. Scattered data from Pakistan, Ethiopia, and even parts of India suggest consolidation of large, often mechanized farms in the prime areas, and a significant amount of tenant eviction. vVhether the institutional framework governmental or traditional that seems to be the key. Improving tenure security seems to be more important and more feasible than imposing rent ceilings,  NON FARMER BENEFITTERS  So far, we have dodged the whole issue of benefitters other than farmers. That is a grievous oversight, for, in the bng run, the bulk of windfall is most likely to go to consumers. Economic theory suggests as much, once a country replaces imports. The Mexican case fully confirms the expectation. Temporary bouts with self-sufficiency or apprehension of it in India, the Philippines and Kenya point in the same direction.  There are a lot of other potential benefitters. We noticed in Mexico that while output per hectare doubled. Farmers were incurring more expenses as they raised yields. A lot of that money was for fertilizer, machinery and machine-services.  In most casesj the fertilizer and farm-machinery induatriss did not make excessive profits from the \"\"green revolution.\"\" Since the mid-1960fe, world fertilizer prices have been at all time lows, as have the profit margins of the fertilizer makerscertainly a factor in speeding the \"\"green revolution\"\", though one that cannot continue.

Some journalists and others tooj even some FAC planners, did contrive to see the dawn of the millenium in the \"\"green revolution\"\", however.  To a limited extent, one could argue that the \"\"green revolution\"\" was a bit over-sold by some of  proponents, like the Rockefeller Foundation. Much more important has been its \"\"overbuying\"\". Back in 1967, Phillippine sociologist Gelia Castillo wrote devastatingly an accurately about \"\"'Miracle Rice' as Produced by the Press.\"\" Now, following a coincidence of droughts and floods, the over-buyers are turning superbears again. It's a good time to pause, to ask what happened, who benefitted, and if possible, where it all leads.  WHAT HAPPENED Until about a century ago, virtually all humans  could afford to be casual about the amount of food mostly grains they got from a unit of farm land. The exceptions to low-yields were peculiar circumstances where nature or enemies obliged a lot of people to live with the little farm land, e.g., Egypt. Then, in Europe, the Indus trial Revolution brought falling death rates, booming population, and, despite massive emigrations, the need to improve agricultural land use. Better techniques were discussed and applied. Crop yields per hectare increased steadily in Europe and the other \"\"Part l\"\" countries, and in the richer centrally-planned economies as well. We cna call it the spread of \"\"scientific\"\" agriculture wothout knowing just what that means.  The poor countries remained in the pattern of low grain yields. The colonial era introduced \"\"scientific\"\" growing of som.e export crops. Late in that era, major advances in public health lowered the death rate. The birth rate and the organization of production, however, remained substantially unchanged. Population was growing rapidly, but crop yields were not, and supplies of farm land were limited. Thence, the apparent Malthusian trap of the mid-1960's.  For some densely populated places, like Java, Egypt or Haiti, the trap seemed to have sprung already. Moreover, it was not easy for them to solve the dilema the way Britain did. The more serious concern, however, was that the world as a whole would run out of farm land, while the economies of two-thirds of the people were unable to keep up with population grov/th either through higher crop yields or through industrial exports.  This pattern and these fears are familiar enough. So, for some, is the story of how a major dent was hammered into the pattern of the poor countries' low grain yields. The Rockefeller Foundation agricultural scientists went to work in Mexico in 1943. Norman Eorlaug and his tea of trigueros were dedicated, and they had all the resources they needed, prestige, and access to the Minister -all enough to make the Mexicans who had preceded them in the field justifiable envious. By 1948, they were releasing new seeds. A constant succession of new varieties has contained the stem-rust problem, allowed for use of more fertilizer, and quadrupled Mexico's wheat yields. M.exico used to have to subsidize wheat farmers and still to import wheat. Through improved techniques, average wheat production costs have been halved, and almost all of this technical windfall now finds its way to the consumer. Cheaper bread means, among other things, cheaper labor costs for industry.  It was not apparent that other poor countries could achieve Mexican results for wheat or anything","page_count":0,"record_type":"secondary","parent_id":"p16022coll345:69542","first_viewer_type":"image","viewer_type":"image","child_index":106,"attachment":"69301.jp2","document_type":"item","featured_collection_order":999,"date_added":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","date_added_sort":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","date_modified":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"p16022coll345:69302","object":"https://cdm16022.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/getthumbnail/collection/p16022coll345/id/69302","set_spec":"p16022coll345","collection_name":"Norman E.

What is profitable for certain farmers is not necessarily profitable for societies. And then, farmers may be forced to adopt a switch, as were Mexican what farmers may not be the only or even the principal benefitters. In Mexico, after a short time, the consumers were, but a large slice of te grains might go to land owners, to fertilizer, chemical or machinery providers, to the government, even to middlemen of farm workers. And, which farmers get that farmers' share? And what happens to farmers, even to regions that cannot adopt the new techniques with profit? And finally, v/hat does it all mean for international trade and balance-of-payments problems?  Most of these questions have no universal answers valid for all countries where the grains are catching on. Let me sum. up the general observations that can be made briefly.  TRADE  To take the last point first, a general answer is easiest to make regarding trade. The \"\"green revolution's\"\" technical changes improve the competitive position of tropical producers with good water control, in the rice case, and the sub-tropical producers for wheat. Unit production costs really are lowered. Y/e have seen that Mexico can now almost compete with the American Plains. The change is not so complete in other countries and cost reductions have been less than the Mexican halving. India is still paying the farmer ca. $100 per ton at the official exchange rate and ca. $75 at an equilibrium one. But the changes are continuing, and other countires are likely to experience Mexico-like effects.  So far the \"\"green revolution\"\" has occurred exclusively in grain-importing countr\"\"ie3. Cutting costs m.eans making their producers better able to complete with imports, hence eroding world-trade demand and narrowing trade. It takes some cheek to stress that effect this year, when floods have hurt rice crops in the Philippines and Indonesia, drought has reduced them from Pakistan through Burma, and Russia, India and China are suddenly buying up all avai lable v/heat too. Years like this notwithstanding, the ''green revolution's\"\" effect is to lower the price an effect which rice exporters in Thailand, Burma and China were only too aware cf bctv/een 1968 ?.nd nov/. Cther things being equal, which we ca.n see they are not, especially this year, poor countries that have been able to put the nev/ varieties to work are closer to self-sufficiency. We can even expect to see a few of them turn to marginal exporters in good years, as Mexico has, though it seems unlikely that their cost structures will let them be consistent exporters. And these countries can hardly afford to dump grain exports at a loss, as certain rich countries unfortunately do.  The effects on adopters and non-adopters, on leaders and laggers, within countries is more ticklish,  REGIONAL EFFECTS  Regional effects are easiest to comment on . In Mexico, wheat production has disappeared from the high, narrow valleys of Michoacan; it is concentrated on broad, irrigated lands, especially in the northwest. Mexican wheats thrive on proper watering, good land preparation and proper seeding depth. \"\"tAHiere water is scarce of good land preparation and seeding are difficult (e.g. hilly land which precludes using a drill seeder), new wheats are less a.ttractive.","page_count":0,"record_type":"secondary","parent_id":"p16022coll345:69542","first_viewer_type":"image","viewer_type":"image","child_index":108,"attachment":"69303.jp2","document_type":"item","featured_collection_order":999,"date_added":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","date_added_sort":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","date_modified":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"p16022coll345:69303","object":"https://cdm16022.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/getthumbnail/collection/p16022coll345/id/69303","set_spec":"p16022coll345","collection_name":"Norman E.

A farmer can change the v/ay he fai.ms, including the amount of fertilizer he applies, but he cannot make it rain or make the rough places plain.  Tne ne\\/ rices are fussy about natural condi'\"\",ions too. Like the wheats, they are superior over a wide range of conditions. Cne frequently hears that the new wheats, rices, and hybrid maize too, are delicate plants requiring sophisticated management. In fact, they are remarkably hardy. Yet no varietj^ is adapted to the entire range of conditions where each grain grov/s. The new rices need plenty of water, but also will not tolerate deep flooding. This m.akes them useles for many areas v/ith poor v/ater control, whether from counting on rainfall or from, uncontrolled, deep flooding.  What happens t) the areas that cannot profitably adopt the new varieties? If the by-passed zones are in a country struggling to replace im.ports, the producers' grain price is probably determined by the world market plus whatever margin of protection is accorded. By-passed areas will not be squeezed out, but will miss out on the technical windfall.  *^nce imports from xhailand or Kansas are replaced, local prices tend to be set by local supply conditions. So far, this situation has been reached only for Mexican wheat. If that is any guide as it prooably is, then real farm prices will decline. Those v/ho cannot adopt the new techniques profitably will be squeezed.  The Philippines, India, Pakistan, Kenya and others may now be coming into the self-sufficiency range, a likelihood not to be obscured by this year's floods and droughts. If so, the same squeeze that squoze wheat farmers with sub-optimal land in Mexico's mesa central will be felt by Philippine rice farm.ers without irrigation, by wheat farmers without irrigation, by wheat farmers in drier Madhaya Pradesh, and by Kenyan maize farmers on the Luo Plain.  Governments and researchers need to be working hard on crops for these farmers principally in semi-arid areas to switch to. Unless the by-passed are quickly provided with profitable alternatives, the \"\"green revolution\"\" will mean their dislocation or deeper poverty.  LEADERS AND DAGGERS  Even in favored areas, there are leaders and laggers. Som^e farmers are quicker to spot a profitable nev/ technique than others, and quicker to jump on the bandwagon. Invariably, these tend to be the more cosm.opolitan, the more travelled, those closer to markets, also the richer and those farming bigger farms.  Much misleading reportage on the \"\"green revolution\"\" stems from taking a snapshot of a situation vv'here leaders have led and laggers are still vacillating. Such a photograph is revealing, but it will not tell us the final result of a process still in m.otion at the moment of snapping.  The richer farmern-with bigger farms are disproportionate benefitters in the early stages of any profitable change in technique. Progressive farmers do obtain an early edge by adopting new rices, wheats, or maize too.

Under the duress of drought and threatned famine in 1965, India and Pakistan decided to take the gamble. It paid off. By 1971, farmers had switched between 40% and 50% of the wheat lands in both countries to Mexican-derived varieties. Problems of local adaptation had been met; no miracle disease had annihilated the new wheats. These new wheats occupied the better farmlands, were first adopted by the better farmers, and intrinsically have better genetic potential; in India and Pakistan, they provided better than half the wheat -probably about two-thirds- by 1971.  Mexican wheats have now made inroads from Morocco to China, though nowhere is the switch over as considerable as in Pakistan and India. Too deep a winter frost in highland Turkey and too little water in north Africa have proved to be diffusion barriers. Still, of the poor contries' wheat lands, if we exclude the Peoples' Republic of China (no figures) and Argentina (more like a Part I country for wheat) roughly one-fifth is sown to Mexican wheats.  THE TURN TO RICE  Founding the International Rice Research Institute in 1962 represented an effort to bring off similar changes for rice= The IRRI and other new high-yielding rices began to have a farm level impact in 1965-66 and now occupy over half the Philippines' rice land. Simultaneously, they have spread to other countries, chiefly in south and southeast Asia. As with the new wheats, India accounts for roughly half the area planted, but Cuba may well be the country the most completely switched over to these new rices.  The new rices are younger than the new wheats. Their international spread has been more rapid, and problems of local adaptation and consumer acceptance have accompanied it.  Even in the Philippines, a tungrovirus epidemic hit the 1971 crop, affecting traditional and many improved rices as well. Mexico had its last wheat stem-rust epidemic a full 11 years after the Rockefeller Program began releasing wheats, however. Perhaps continued breeding and adaptive research will solve some of the new rices' problems. And, even now, excluding China, new Philippine rices and their close relatives cover about one-tenth of the Part II countries' rice land.  There is no comparable revolution for man's next most important grains -maize and sorghum. The kernel of a maize revolution may be germinating in east Africa; Kenya's Kitale hybrids now cover one-fourth of Kenya's maize land and are spreading rapidly both there and in Ethiopia, Uganda and Tanzania. Countries as diverse as Brazil and Thailand are experiencing success with synthetic maize. These developments are embryonic compared to wheat and rice though, and the lack of a break-through for sorghum - so well adapted to m^uch of the world's drier lands - is disappointing.  WHO BENEFITS  Several million wheat and rice farmers have adopted the new, high-yielding varieties. (The number of Kitale maize adopters is in the order of magnitude of 50, 000. ) That all these independent and canny decision-m.akers are doing the same thing suggests that there is something in it for them. It's highly unlikely that they have been acting out of sheer patriotism or devotion to plan directives.","page_count":0,"record_type":"secondary","parent_id":"p16022coll345:69542","first_viewer_type":"image","viewer_type":"image","child_index":107,"attachment":"69302.jp2","document_type":"item","featured_collection_order":999,"date_added":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","date_added_sort":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","date_modified":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"p16022coll345:69304","object":"https://cdm16022.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/getthumbnail/collection/p16022coll345/id/69304","set_spec":"p16022coll345","collection_name":"Norman E.

On this point, lessons of experience are mixed. The mixed results are not produced by the new seeds, which can be grown by the smallest, poorest farmer ;\"\" he can be grown by the smallest, poorest farmer if he can get land, water, and perhaps, credit 'til harvest to permit fertilizer use. The institutional fra.meworks into which the new seeds are being introduced vary widely however. They may enable the large, progressive farmer to deprive his neighbors of the requisites to benefit from the new seeds; they may not-  We can't exhaust this issue here. Access to land is paramount though. If a small number of privileged farmers are allowed to control a country's prime farm land, the \"\"green revolution's\"\" impact is predictable. If tenants occupy such land but have no security of tenure, progressive farmers and landlords will probably displace them between the lead and the lag.  Such is frequently not the case, however. Mexico and Kenya have ha.d recent land reforms; sm.all farmiers occupy a significant part of the prime land and cannot easily be put off it. They marginally less efficient than bigger farmers, but they are benefitting from the new grains.  So are small Philippine farmers, many of them share tenants (until this year anyhow). Their position has been protected by traditional ties, possission of guns, and, increasingly, govern-menta.1 support, and evictions have been rare. Landlords benefit from share arrangements as productivity rises, but they also assume some costs and risks. Ironically, many Philippine tenants, switched to fixed rents under a government program, found themselves cut off from credit and less able to adopt innovations.  Not all experiences have been so relatively felicitous. Scattered data from Pakistan, Ethiopia, and even parts of India suggest consolidation of large, often mechanized farms in the prime areas, and a significant amount of tenant eviction. Whether the institutional framework-governmental or traditionalthat seems to be the key. Improving tenure security seems to be more important and more feasible than imposing rent ceilings,  NON FARMER BENEFITTERS  So far, v/e have dodged the whole issue of benefitters other than farmers. That is a grievous oversight, for, in the bng run, the bulk of windfall is most likely to go to consumers. Economic theory suggests as much, once a country replaces imports. The Mexican case fully confirms the expectation. Temporary bouts with self-sufficiency or apprehension of it in India, the Philippines and Kenya point in the same direction.  There are a lot of other potential benefitters. We noticed in Mexico that while output per hectare doubled. Farmers were incurring more expenses as they raised yields. A lot of that money was for fertilizer^ machinery and machine-services.  In most casesj the fertilizer and farm-machinery industries did not make excessive profits from the \"\"green revolution. \"\" Since the mid-1960^, world fertilizer prices have been at all time lows, as have the profit margins of the fertilizer mak'^rscertainly a factor in speeding the \"\"green revolution\"\", though one that cannot continue.

But again, these national policies were not part of a world pattern of farmer exploitation. Other governments, like Pakistan, beni; the other way to subsidize farmers' use of fertilizer and i-nachinery.  K iddlemen, frequently perceived as running off with the windfall, can do so only if they can collude to extract monopoly profits. Evidence suggests that, for grain, they rarely succeed in doing this. The buyer most likely to establish a m-onopoly to the detriment of the farmer is the government, but worry about the V/orld Food Problem and the im,port bill has usually made governments chary of doing this of late.  THE LABOR PUZZLE  Finally, the benefits to labor are a hot issue. Some scholars have noticed that intensification of grain-growing has driven northwest Mexico, and around IRRI in the Philippines. It has. So has the v/age probably fallen in by-passed regions.  All in all, the new seeds lower the labor componentrequire less labor per ton of grain. Comparing new varieties and old ones with similar techniques, the diminution seems to be ca. 257c for wheat in Ethiopia, 25% for rice in the Philippines and possibly 40% for maize in Kenya.  V/hen a.ccom.panying changes in techniques are thrown in, the labor-component reduction may be greater; Mexican mechanized, rationalized wheat production now requires 10-15% of the labor per ton that it did 20 years ago.  That the \"\"green revolution\"\" is labor-saving (i.e., job destroying) does not mean that we ought to turn back the clock. For one thing, labor sabing looks different depending on whether you can replace other people's jobs (grain imports) or whether it's your own. For another thing, we haven't measured its effects on non-farm employment in fertilizer factories, tool-repa.ir shops, wine-and-spirits shops, and more industrial employment as a result of lower food costs.  We must also be careful to separate effects of new seeds from those of mechanization, which often accompanies it but need not. Tractorization is subsidized in many countries through cheap imports and cheap credit (some from the Bank). Countries and lenders which are also spending a lot of money to cope with unemployment are beginning to take a hard look at these policies. Perhaps, in such circumstances, labor-intensive farming techniques should be given a free hand (or more) in competing with capital-intensive ones, but only careful economic analysis can give the right answer.  WHERE DOES IT ALL LEAD?  The most honest answer to our third question is that we don't know. We simply can't say \"\"who will win the food-population race. \"\" At first glance, it looks as though continuation of present demographic trends leads to absurd situationspeople standing on each other's head and what not. That way, the World Population Problem would be solved all rightby rising death rates.  But then, it is just conceivable that food scientists will come up with a new break-through just in time we seem to be running out of food.

(Prepared by Mrs. Clarence F. Swift)  Mrs. Mary Church Terrell, a graduate of Oberlin College with a distinguished record of public service (see page 3), is a member of the national American Association of University Women. She was a member of the Washington Branch in the early 1900's, but dropped out because of pressure of other activities. In recent years, however, she has on numerous occasions been the guest of members at the clubhouse.  On October 8, 1946, Mrs. Terrell applied, at the office, for reinstatement in the Branch, and paid a years dues. Her former membership was vouched for by one of the oldest and most respected members of the Branch and has since been confirmed by others, although records for that period have not yet been found. Mrs. Terrell's sponsor is Mrs.  Clarence F. Swift, 1020 19th Street, N.W.; Mrs* Swift is also an Oberlin graduate, a close friend of Mrs. Terrell since college days, a member of the national A.A.U.W. since 1884 and of the Washington Branch since 1939.  i  On October 9 the president of the Branch, Mrs. G. R. Wilhelm, called a meeting of the Executive Committee (the nine elected officers) to consider Mrs'. Terrell's application. The Committee is empowered to act between the meetings of the Board of Directors, which consists of the elected officers plus the chairmen of standing committees. Eight members of the Committee were present, and voted unanimously (the president not voting) to reject the application. They notified Mrs. Terrell and returned her money. Mrs. Wilhelm also informed Mrs. Swift. No reason was given for the action.  On October 11, Mrs. Swift, as Mrs. Terrell's sponsor, wrote to each member of the Board of Directors inquiring the basis for the rejection by the Executive Committee and appealing for consideration of the question by the Board.  On October 14 the Board held its regular monthly meeting. Of the twenty-one members, sixteen were present, and all but one (the president not voting) voted to uphold the action of the Executive Committee. Again no reason was given.  The By-laws contain no provision for any review of applications for membership. See page 2 for information regarding membership requirements and other pertinent matters.  A number of members have written to the president of the Branch wrote sting the rejection of the application, and asking that it be reconsidered by the Board.","page_count":0,"record_type":"secondary","parent_id":"p16022coll95:33","first_viewer_type":"image","viewer_type":"image","child_index":1,"attachment":"31.jp2","document_type":"item","featured_collection_order":999,"date_added":"2019-02-26T00:00:00Z","date_added_sort":"2019-02-26T00:00:00Z","date_modified":"2019-02-26T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"p16022coll287:561","object":"https://cdm16022.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/getthumbnail/collection/p16022coll287/id/561","set_spec":"p16022coll287","collection_name":"Birds of America Folio","collection_description":"The University of Minnesota's Bell Museum has digitized and made openly available their copy of John James Audubon's \"Birds of America.\" This collection highlights the beauty and diversity of birds inhabiting North America.","title":"Plate 003 (Plate III), Prothonotary Warbler","title_search":"Plate 003 (Plate III), Prothonotary Warbler","title_sort":"plate003plateiiiprothonotarywarbler","title_alternative":"Sylvia Protonotarius (Audubon scientific name);  Prothonotary Warbler (current common name);  Protonotaria citrea (current scientific name)","creator":["Audubon, John James, 1785-1851"],"creator_sort":"audubonjohnjames17851851","contributor":["Havell, R.

NOTE.The method of study under thi.1^ head is not to make a proposition and then endeavor to support it by Scripture, but to bring together all the Scriptures bearing upon any topic, and from them to ascertain and formulate the teachings of the Bible.

A very thorough study of the Bible under these various heads is attempted, but at the close a brief summary of passages for constant use is given.

About a_ year after the Mexican trip I saw him again. I hadn't published anything, so I'd obviously had no bearing on his elVectiveness. But he may have done it .some damage himself, not in terms of the acceptance of his work abroad, but of support for it at home. If the agricultural techniques of the Green Revolution were much more widely admired now because of the Nobel Prize, there was ahso more publicity for its critics, who continued to take alarm, particularly at the world-  One of the Green Revolution Boys  wide spread of pesticides, on which much of the new productivity depends.  He responded to the criticisms in his younger character; he reverted to being a lighter, with scores to settle. In a controversial specch in Rome, he called environmentalists \"\"myopic and hysterical\"\" and their policies \"\"disastrous.\"\" He had had a chance, been in a position, to have great itnpact on people in this country. There were not, after all. very manv Nobel Peace Prize winners around who were first-rate speakers, inspiring men, crack scientists, and experienced at moving governments. He'd lost the chance. And I'd become too much his advocate in our few meetings not to care.  1 think he was too much out of touch with valid and important currents of American concern about the environment, and did not know the quality of its leadership, only that of its cranks; and I think he simply didn't take lime (or maybe have time) to think through the relationship of his work to those concerns in a way that would permit him to offer us fresh wi.sdom from a man of demonstrated judgment and integrity, a scientist and humanitarian established beyond criticism in his tield.  I can see the diflerence, in my notes from Mexico, between the things he had to say about conservation in 1970 and those he was saying about conservationists a year later, in the fall of 1971. As a forester, he had a deep knowledge of ecology as a field of study years before most Americans had ever heard the word. His attitude in Mexico had been judicious, humane, and not without sorrow. On the North American continent he felt we still had the space, the lack of population density, and the aflluence to be able to alford to concern ourselves with environmental deterioration. We could try to save our wildlife, our water, our air, our woodlands, and then function best, if we could learn to control our own population, and thereby demonstrate our restraint and good management to other nations. We could try to prove, for example, that breeding disease resistance into crops is better ecology and better economy than heavy use of pesticides, and try to become in this and many other ways a model environment.  Meanwhile, though, as far as other continents were concerned, if the tragic choice had to be madeand often it did-between, say, preserving wildlife and saving human lives, he didn't have it in him not to choosc humanity. For another example, disease-bcaiing in.sects had to be controlled or the tropics would become uninhabitable wouldn't it make more sense to support crash programs of research on how to control them with the least cnvirunmcntal damage than to insist on a worldwide ban of DDT? It did not secrn to him acceptable to limit the alternatives to a baby dying of malaria on the one side, or a hawk laying thin-shelled eggs i n the other.

R. BRADFIELD: Unlike the temperate zones where  INTENSIVE MULTIPLE climatic conditions permit crop cultiva-  CROPPING tion only during the summer months,  the tropical and subtropical climates allow year-round crop growth. Because of this fact, the tropical regions contain the world's greatest untapped resource for food production.  Prerequisites to the achievement of maximum food production in tropical countries are the wide adoption of modern agricultural science and technology and the full control of water. Although most tropical countries have adequate annual rainfall, the monthly distribution is usually very, uneven. If the year-round favorable temperatures for crop growth are to be fully utilized, water control is a necessity.  The three general methods by which a country may increase its food production are (1) expanding the area planted to food crops, (2) increasing the yields of crops per unit area, and (3) increasing the number of crops grown per unit area per year.  With rapidly expanding populations, many countries find that land available for agricultural use is becoming scarce. Much of the presently unused land is remote, of poor quality, or lacks irrigation or drainage facilities. Thus, the real potential lies in the more intensive use of land now under cultivation.  Most tropical countries have not done enough research to fully understand the best procedures falling under the second and third alternatives. The use of water, methods of planting and inter planting, efficiency of fertilizer use,  insect and disease control, and suitable year-round crop rotation are but a few of the points that need intensified and continuous study. It is for these reasons that The International Rice Research Institute started a multiple cropping i-osonvch program several years ago.

LAND USE Effective multiple cropping minimizes  the number of days the available agricultural land is idle. The traditional methods of making efficient use of the land were studied using various crops. After numerous preliminary trials. Institute scientists are confining their attention primarily to rice, vegetables, soybeans, sweet corn, field corn,  grain sorghum and sweet potatoes.  RICE - THE PRIMARY Rice is eaten by more people in the  CROP tropics than any other crop. Also, in the  monsoon tropics, rice is the only major crop that thrives in soils saturated with water for long periods. A multiple cropping system for the tropics must therefore be designed around a main crop of rice to be grown in the wet season.  OTHER CROPS The sweet potato has been a leader in the  rotation of rice with upland crops. It is the principal food crop of many Polynesian peoples and thrives in tropical and subtropical areas all over the world. Few food crops can produce as many calories per hectare and many of the newer varieties are also rich in B-carotene, a precursor of Vitamin A,  which is deficient in the diets of many rice-eating people. The tender tips of the vines are widely used as greens for human beings and the entire vine, as well as the roots, are a valuable feed for livestock.  The soybean grows well in the tropics. It has been widely used in many forms as a food in Japan, China, and Indonesia. Diets in much of Asia are deficient in protein and the soybean is one of the richest sources of high quality plant protein known to man, averaging about 40% protein and 20% oil. Food processors are manufacturing a large number of nutritious fpods from soybeans including jnilk, flour, and meat substitutes. It is widely used as a food in the green, immature state in Japan, China. Hawaii. Thai^nd. and Indonesi,a.  h^arly preri-mmarv experiments indicate that it will producjs in the Philippines from two to three times as much protein per hectare per day as any pulse crop now being commonly grown.  Corn is the second most important food crop in the Philippines and much of Latin America and Africa. While sweet corn is not as widely grown as field corn in the Philippines, it will probably eventually replace some of the field corn as a food crop. It is ready to eat in 60-70 days after planting and can be grown every month of the year.  Grain sorghum, is the third most important food crop in the world. Only rice and wheat surpass it. It can tolerate both drought and wet soil better than corn. It will yield as much grain per dav in the tropics as corn, but has the advantage that it can be ratooned and as many as three crops harvested from one planting.","page_count":0,"record_type":"secondary","parent_id":"p16022coll345:69542","first_viewer_type":"image","viewer_type":"image","child_index":19,"attachment":"69214.jp2","document_type":"item","featured_collection_order":999,"date_added":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","date_added_sort":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","date_modified":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"p16022coll345:69214","object":"https://cdm16022.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/getthumbnail/collection/p16022coll345/id/69214","set_spec":"p16022coll345","collection_name":"Norman E.

Rice 102 ^__Y  For rice, the first crop, ridges about 25 cm. high and one meter apart from center to center are thrown up, usually with a disc ridger. A strip 60-70 cm.  wide between the ridges is levelled with a rotovator or disc cultivator. Three rows of a high-yielding rice variety, such as IRS, are drilled 25 cm. apart on this unpuddled strip in early June at the beginning of the rainy season. This method is easily mechanized and can save time. It has the added advantage that the soil dries out faster after the rice is harvested and the following crop can be planted sooner.  The unflooded rice is usually cultivated once or twice, and any weeds that survive this cultivation are removed by hand hoeing. When the rice is about 30 om. high (30-40 days after drilling), the soil is sprayed with an herbicide and flooded the following day. The water level is maintained between 5 cm. below and 5 cm. above the soil surface antil about ten days before harvest, when any surplus remaining on the soil surface is drained off. Yields of 4-5. 5 mt of rough rice have been consistently obtained by this method.  As soon as the soil is dry enough after the rice is harvested, the ridges are renewed with the disc ridger and the second crop--in this case, svreet potato cuttings--are transplanted on the ridge tops. The sweet potato plants can also be transferred to these ridges before the rice is harvested, thereby saving 10-20 days.  When the sweet potatoes are ready for harvesting, 90-100 days later, the vines are removed and the sweet potatoes plowed out with a \"\"middle buster\"\".

A rapid growth in private tubewells which had been going on for a number of years even prior to 1964 gained a further momentum in the years after 1964. In fact mid-1964 was the real turning-point in the history of agricultural development in West Pakistan.  The three major components of green revolution in West Pakistan have been an investment in private tubewells, high-yield seeds, and increased use of fertihzers. Therefore, although this green revolution is more broad-based than a mere chance acceptance of 'miracle seeds', yet it is not broad-based enough to have become institutionahzed in the agricultural system of West Pakistan. So in a nutshell, although the green revolution did occur, it has yet to become institutionalized. A great deal of sustained effort is still needed to see this green revolution through into an era of expanding technology and self-perpetuating growth. On the other hand, the green revolution has already created a whole set of second-generation problems relating to equity, marketing, and prices, which must be dealt with adequately, if the growth, already achieved, is to be sustained and accelerated. Also it must be admitted that lasting progress is not achieved through occasional breakthroughs. It can be sustained only through institutions which on one hand are permanent enough, so that the policy-makers and the farmers are able to set their sights on the long-range and on the other hand flexible enough to be able to accommodate the fluctuating needs of agricultural progress. In the institutionalization of green revolution, an area which would require first attention of the government is that of a highly tuned agricultural policy based on a careful quantitative analysis of relationships now obtaining in the agriculture of West Pakistan.  The problem  It is being said that the phenomenon of green revolution in West Pakistan is leading her to a serious problem of 'duality' or 'polarization' of the farm population into two distinct sectorsa progressively modern sector and the other a regressively backward sector. This problem of 'duality' has two aspectsinter-regional and intra-regional.

M. AZAM  THE FUTURE OF THE GREEN REVOLUTION IN WEST PAKISTAN: A CHOICE OF STRATEGY'  An overview ^  A DOUBT has come to persist in certain quarters that the much talked-about green revolution in fact never occurred in West Pakistan. It is not important what name is given to this phenomenon. What is important is to understand its components in their true perspective. For decades the agriculture in West Pakistan had remained stagnant. Then suddenly within a period of two to three years spectacular mcreases in the agricultural production occurred. The wheat production went up from its traditional figure of 4 million tons m 1966-7 to more than 6 million tons in 1967-8, adding about 1,000 rtullion rupees to the GNP. Rice production in 1969-70 was up by 78 per cent over 1966-7. The increase in maize production in 1967-8 was 47 per cent over 1964-5. Different people would describe this phenomenon in different words but the fact that this three-pronged breakthrough occurred in only three years, from 1967 to 1970, shows that it could have only been adequately described by a word such as revolution'.  Another fallacy which has persisted is that the green revolution has been precariously based on Mexican wheat and IRRI rice. No doubt ^ese two seeds have been the major engines of growth in West Pakistan s agriculture but an equally important aspect, which must not be lost sight of, is that the foundations of green revolution had in fact been gradually laid in the years prior to the commercial introduction of Mexican wheat and IRRI rice in 1967-8. To quote an example, in late 1963 there was an excess stock in West Pakistan of about 250,000 tons of fertilizers but by November 1964 not only had all the excess stocks been disposed of but the WPIDC factories had unfilled orders of 185,000 tons.

This sweet corn will reach a height of 18-24 inches by the time the soybeans are ready to harvest as dry beans. After the soybeans are harvested, the sweet corn is hilled up with a disc cultivator. The final irrigation for the sweet corn is applied in the newly formed furrow. When the corn is tasselling, two or three soybean seeds are planted between each hill of sweet corn. In three weeks the sweet corn is harvested, leaving the soybeans to grow on the ridge without competition.  When the soybeans are 4-5 weeks old, a strip 60-55 cm. wide at the bottom of the furrow is leveled with a small rotovator and three rows of 25-cm-apart rice are planted on this strip. The soybeans will be ready to harvest green 3-4 weeks after the rice is planted. After the soybeans are hai-vested, the rice is given a final cultivation or weeding, if needed. It will be 25-30 cm tall by this time. Prom this period on, the rice crop is managed as described previously.  The annual cycle is thus complete. Good crops of rice, sweet potatoes, dry soybeans, sweet corn, and green soybeans have been grown in one calendar year on the same land.  This system is very flexible and modifications can be made by varying crop sequences according to price or demand. Furthermore, if the main rice crop is damaged by a typhoon or disease, rice can be substituted for one of the other crops.  The work at the Institute will go on year after year to explore more efficient cropping systems and management methods. Already, as much as 22.

Thus the rich farmers may becomc richcr and the poor poorer.^  Secondly, under the pressure of abundant harvests, there is a great downward pressure on farm prices. As a result the large farmers find that m order to cut their costs they have to expand the acreage and make their operations more commercially oriented. In their case, once investments are made in fixed assets (such as tractors), the short-run cost function becomes lower than the long-run cost function.3 Since feed costs are costs forgone in the short-run, it does not affect the short-run supply of output. Prices of the produce can fall to the levels that cover only variable costs and not fixed costs. The impact of such a situation can be disastrous to small farmers whose total costs are largely variable.

Hypothesis i: that farmers with small holdings have been unable to adopt dwarf wheats as economically they face great risk and uncertainty with new varieties.  In the summer of 1969 an extensive survey of 502 farmers was conducted by Dr. Mushtaq Hussain^ in the districts of Rawalpindi Sahiwal, and Lyallpur (in the Punjab Province), Dadu, Hyderabad, and Nawabshah (in the Sind Province). Though the data were priniarily used to measure the opportunity cost of switching from local wheats to Mexican dwarf varieties, the reported results give us some idea o the use of the new varieties in these districts. Dr. Mushtaq Hussains survey showed that the districts of the Punjab and Nawabshah in the Sind, with average farm size of less than 17 acres had at least 25 per cent of their total farm area sown with Mexican dwarfs. On the other hand, the larger farms of Hyderabad and Dadu districts (34 acres and 42-60 acres respectively) had proportionately less of their area (14 per  cent) sown with the new varieties.

Dear Stak:  We have reached the stage in our agricultural program where we want to obtain a plant pathologist to assume direct responsibility for this work. Our agricultural program will be largely confined to soil sterilants and fumigants, and seed treatments including such related applications as the treatment of sugar cane cuttings. There will be some sale of our phenylmercuric acetate to firms like Stauffer, Food Machinery and Grange League Federation who now use it as a raw material for certain agricultural sprays such as those for apple scab. However^ we want to concentrate our efforts for the foreseeable future on the primary applications noted. We have products which are being used for these applications at present with more products expected in the future from our research programs on organic sulfur compounds and organic mercury compounds.  You have a good appreciation of the kind of a man we need. We prefer a man between 3Q and 35 years of age who has his dociorate in plant pathology and who has had several years of experience in the primary fields noted in the foregoing. He must be capable of working cooperatively with the personnel of experiment stations on plans for tests. In some cases, we vjill sponsor the work financially and in others merely encourage it by transmitting information to them. He should be willing to travel as necessary in the United States and in foreign countries. Although he will do no actual selling of our products, he must have a high degree of self motivation and be able to inspire faith on the part of the people he contacts. A number of our recent additions to our sales group have their doctorates in microbiology and essentially all future ones will have. Our Agricultural Microbiologist thus will have sound backing by our sales group, all of whom function on the basis of selling by the solution of problems. However, this in one sense increases rather than decreases the need for a man of unusual motivation and con^jetence for the position which we are creating.  The salary is open depending upon the training and experience of the man. There will be adequate opportvinity for financial advancement and the right man will have all of the thrills which are obtained from taking a relatively new phase of our activity as his \"\"baby\"\" and making it grow.

Among the respondents, 96 per cent had less than 12 cropped acres and 70 per cent had less than 5; the average size of holding that was cultivated was about 4-9 acres per family. In addition, the families averaged between 9 and 10 people; about 2 to 3 per cropped acre. About 8 per cent were tenants and the rest were owners of the land they had under plough. According to the findings, change was taking place at a very rapid rate with the adoption of new dwarf wheats (particularly Mexipak-65) and fertilizer. Out of the total sample, only two had never heard of Mexipak at the time of the interview and 98 (69 per cent) were already dwarf wheat adopters.  Particularly striking is the realization that there was very little crop research done under barani conditions to identify better wheat varieties for barani farmers. Instead it was found that barani smallholders initially experimented with handfuls of seed (borrowed from neighbours and purchased locally), observed the results with their own experiments, and increased the area sown with dwarf wheats the following season.  Results of this study confirm significant differences in yield between dwarf and desi wheats by a consistently wide margin; enough to make the adoption of dwarf wheats by barani smallholders a profitable investment; dwarf wheats outyielded local wheats by over 100 per cent on the three-year average from 1967-8 to 1969-70. However, since rainfall is so important to barani wheat cultivation, it should be noted that the areas surveyed (in Mansehra and Abbotabad Tehsils) received a relatively normal rainfall (around 15 inches) from early October to  late April 1967-70.

During the survey, it was revealed by these farmers that they had resorted to local wheats due to an acute shortage of irrigation water during Rabi, 1970-1. All these farmers further revealed that, had there been no constraint of irrigation water, they would have grown only Mexican wheats. Although the above table does indicate that the small farmers are facing a constraint of resources (irrigation water) to some extent, we may conclude that the farm size does not have any significant effect on the adoption of Mexican wheat.  In terms of tenure, our survey revealed that in the case of peasant-proprietors 92-16 per cent of their total wheat acreage was devoted to Mexican varieties. The corresponding figures were 98-28 per cent and loo-oo per cent in the case of owner-cum-tenants and tenants respectively. Our survey further revealed that 78-88 per cent of peasant-proprietors, 97*30 per cent of owner-cum-tenants and 100 per cent of the tenants were growing only Mexican wheats. Thus, according to our survey the type of tenure had no effect whatsoever on the adoption  of Mexican varieties of wheat.  In view of the above evidence, we can safely reject the hypothesis that farmers with small holdings have been unable to adopt dwarf wheats.","page_count":0,"record_type":"secondary","parent_id":"p16022coll345:69542","first_viewer_type":"image","viewer_type":"image","child_index":32,"attachment":"69227.jp2","document_type":"item","featured_collection_order":999,"date_added":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","date_added_sort":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","date_modified":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"p16022coll345:69225","object":"https://cdm16022.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/getthumbnail/collection/p16022coll345/id/69225","set_spec":"p16022coll345","collection_name":"Norman E.

Eckert' interviewed 115 farmers in the Sahiwal District during 1969.

On the small and large farms desi wheats averaged 16-54 and 15-35 maunds^ per acre respectively' dwarf wheats averaged 22-04 and 24-48. However, there were moderate differences in some input levels.

Secondly, imder the pressure of abundant harvests, there is a great downward pressure on farm prices. As a result the large farmers find that in order to cut their costs, they have to expand the acreage and make their operations more commercially orientedo In their case once investments are made in fixed assets(such as tractors), the short-run cost function^ecome^ lower than the long-run cost function? Since fixed c^sTsare costs foregone in the short-run, it does not affect the short-run supply of output. Prices of the produce can fall to the levels that cover only variable costs and not fixed costs. The impact of such a situation can be disastrous to small farmers whose total costs are largely variable. Therefore, it is contended that unless a special effort is made to take this nevr technology to the smaller farmers^ the green revolution will give rise to socially explosive problems of income distribution.  This is the problem vrhich v/e intend to examine in this paper. It has two main components,- In part II of this paper we would examine the hypothesis that green revolution has not yet reached the small farmers particularly those in the backvrard and barani areas,  while in part III, wc vjould analyse the two distinct choices of models or strategies v/hich are open to West Pakistan that is (i), concentration of development effort on top 25 per ceht of the farmers possessing at least 1236 acres of land olr (ii) making a special effort to take the technology of the green revolution to all the farmers in all the regions of Uest Pakistan, A conclusion based on the above discussion is presented in Part IV,  1 In case of small subsistence farmers in the non-monetized sector, the poor will not get poorer per se but, of course, they will get relatively poorer as compared with the rich farmers v^ho will get richero  2 VThen the fixed costs are not included in a short-rvm average cost curve, then obviously this curve would fall below the long-run average cost curve which includes both the variable costs and fixed costs.","page_count":0,"record_type":"secondary","parent_id":"p16022coll345:69542","first_viewer_type":"image","viewer_type":"image","child_index":58,"attachment":"69253.jp2","document_type":"item","featured_collection_order":999,"date_added":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","date_added_sort":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","date_modified":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"p16022coll345:69255","object":"https://cdm16022.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/getthumbnail/collection/p16022coll345/id/69255","set_spec":"p16022coll345","collection_name":"Norman E.

According to the Punjab Planning and Development Department's survey of the three irrigated districts of the Central Punjab, 85 per cent of the farmers have adopted the dwarf wheats. Of the 15 per cent of the farmers who did not grow any Mexican wheat 43 per cent cited lack of water as the main reason and 37 per cent said they preferred the taste of desi wheat.  On the basis of Lowdermilk's findings, the most limiting constraints on the smallholders ability to raise overall crop production appeared to be water and credit (which could be used to purchase fertihzer and other factors of production, including tubewell water). In particular, farmers with less than 25 acres reported 'that sufficient tubewell water was not easily available to them for Rabi 1969-70'.' The same category of farmers also reported that fertilizer was not easily available for the same growing period.

The above table shows that the smaller farmers in the first two categories faced much greater constraints in using the desired amount of fertilizers. The lack of credit was the most important constraint faced by all categories of farmers except the largest. The second most important constraint was the lack of irrigation water. The nonavailability of fertilizers at the right time and the distance of fertilizer sale point were also quoted as difficulties to varying extents, by all categories of farmers except the largest.  During our survey of Harmoia village we also asked the cultivators what, according to them, were the main constraints on the farm production. Their answers have been tabulated in Table 12.  This table clearly shows that irrigation water followed by credit were the most important constraints feh by the farmers in Harmoia village. It is interesting to note that the larger farmers stated plant protection as the most important constraint on the farm production.

This survey revealed a minimal adoption of Mexican wheat during Rabi 1970-1; only half an acre of Mexican wheat was sown by one farmer in the more than 6 to 12-50 acres category. Fertilizer was being used by only 6-6 per cent of farmers having holdings of up to 6 acres, 17-77 of farmers having more  than 6 acres to 12-50 acres, 16-66 per cent of farmers having more than 12-50 acres to 25 acres, and 20 per cent of farmers having more than 25 acres. Those farmers who did not use any fertilizer cited lack of water as the sole reason. We also asked the farmers what, according to them, were the main constraints on their farm production. While all categories of farmers listed lack of water as a constraint, lack of credit was quoted as a constraint by 53-33 per cent of farmers having holdings up to 6 acres, by 36-36 per cent of farmers having more than 6 acres to 12-50 acres, 8-33 percent of farmers having holdings of more than 12-50 to 25 acres, whereas farmers having more than 25 acres did not feel that lack of credit was a constraint on farm production.'  Thus we find that while the rate of adoption of new technology in the barani areas receiving an adequate rainfall had been very rapid, there was a considerable difference in yields in these areas as compared with the irrigated plains of West Pakistan. On the other hand in the drier barani areas, not only were the yields very low, but the adoption of the new technology was also minimal. In view of this, we do not reject the second part of the hypothesis that there are no interregional differences in the sharing of the benefits of 'green revolution'.

Although the evidence presented above does indicate that small farmers are facing a relatively more severe constraint of resources as compared with larger farmers, particularly with regard to irrigation water and credit, this constraint is not so severe that it would inhibit the adoption of new technology by small farmers to any significant extent. The small yield differentials that have been noticed between large and small farmers are primarily due to the fact that large farmers are able to use more nearly optimum dosages of fertilizer coupled with irrigation water. Clearly, yield differentials are not large enough to have created as yet any serious problem of 'duality' or 'polarization'. This, however, does not mean that we can afford to be complacent; urgent and co-ordinated action is needed with regard to enhanced credit and irrigation water supplies to the small farmers. These facts must be kept in mind while planning for the irrigated agriculture in West Pakistan.  The physical production, however, is only a part of the total benefits: the quantum of benefits accruing to small or large farmers is also a function of the prices received by them. It is also pertinent to note that the socio-political risk involved in 'duality' is not a function of the rate of adoption of new technology per se but of difference in the quantum of benefits flowing to different groups of people and different regions. It has been observed that in West Pakistan a major supply increase generated by the new technology exerted a great downward pressure on the harvest prices of foodgrains, e.g. the harvest price of wheat fell down to Rs. 13.00 or even Rs. 12.00 per maund during 19678, as against the support price of Rs. 17.00 per maund fixed by the Goverrunent. In such circumstances the quantum of benefits flowing to the farmers becomes a function of the ability of the farmers to sell their produce at the Government support price. If the institutional arrangements set up by the Government for this purpose have a bias towards the larger farmers, this would obviously lead to a gap in the quantum of benefits which flow to these two categories of farmers.

Squeezing the Kulaks  The first model recommends the continuation and consolidation of the trends of change which are already apparent in West Pakistan's agriculture, i.e. helping only those farmers who have the wherewithal M-11 A? u technology. This model has all the essentials of the Mill Marshalhan model (except for the problem small subsistence tarms) in which the Government tries to push the speed of the 'agricultural treadmill' by priming the pump and then squeezing the yeomanry m the interests of sustained economic growth. In other words, this model recommends concentration of the scarce public resources on those farmers who ahready possess an adequate resource base, givmg them all the policy and institutional support with a view to capturing the large agricultural surpluses generated by them This model places a premium on the skills and management abilities of the farmers. A small inefficient farmer is left way behind in this model and is either forced to live on a barest minimum margin or is pushed out of the agricultural sector. While these peasants/sharecroppers continue to exist on the farms, agriculture renders a welfare service to the non-farm sector. When they are pushed out, these farmers have a social cost to the economy which presently is being estimated at Ks. 15,000 per worker displaced.'  The timing m this model is rather crucial. It would be fine if the rate of displacement of farm workers were equal to the rate of their absorption by the non-farm sector of the economy. This is, however se dom possible.

They suffer in every way. As food sellers their prices fall. As buyers of labour they face wages rises.'  Contrary to expectations, fortunately the position in West Pakistan as shown by the empirical analysis in Part II of this paper is not so dismal. The small farmers in the irrigated plains of West Pakistan who are perhaps much more 'plugged into the system' than are the Indian or Latin American small farmers and also due to their better resource base seem to have been able, to a large extent, to adopt the new technolo^. The only problem areas for them seem to be the shortage of irrigation water, credit, and adequate price supports.  The usefulness of this model, particularly in the initial stages of development cannot be overrated. West Pakistan should consider Itself fortunate in that even after fifteen years of planned development, this model, which is relatively inexpensive, is still largely applicable m her socio-political context. This model would become still more acceptable if the rate of labour displacement on West Pakistan farms, and thus its social costs, are kept at a minimum. This can be done by adopting public policies which will inhibit adoption of 'mechanical-engineering' technology rather than aid it. This model in the context of West Pakistan would, however, pose a problem of regional equity m that the new technology is mainly relevant to the irrigated areas which form only 50 per cent of the total cultivated area of West Pakistan.  B. Pampering the peasants  The second model has been built around the assumption that in order to achieve a lasting progress in the agricultural sector, the new technology must be taken to each and every farmer; only then a framework for a self-perpetuating growth would be established. In the case of this model, however, the economic theory is not as obliging as in the case of the former, in providing a theoretical framework. The objective of an economy is of course 'Pareto-optimality', but Pareto-optimality is an 'empty box', having no notion of distributive justice. Moreover, it is difficult to specify the social welfare function of a nation. Whilst the rules for attaining an optimum efficiency in the use and allocation of resources, under a given pattern of income distribution, are clearly definable and generally acceptable, their significance is dependent upon the nature of the social welfare function relating to gains and losses of a particular individual and groups and the","page_count":0,"record_type":"secondary","parent_id":"p16022coll345:69542","first_viewer_type":"image","viewer_type":"image","child_index":45,"attachment":"69240.jp2","document_type":"item","featured_collection_order":999,"date_added":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","date_added_sort":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","date_modified":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"p16022coll345:69241","object":"https://cdm16022.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/getthumbnail/collection/p16022coll345/id/69241","set_spec":"p16022coll345","collection_name":"Norman E.

Thus although the concept of a social welfare function is clear enough, the determination of its empirical content, which must rest upon consensus in a particular society, encounters serious conceptual and practical difficulties. Nevertheless, it is not difficult to admit that the transfer of one rupee from a millionaire to a starving person would increase the satisfaction of the latter more than it decreased the satisfaction of the former. That this is a value judgement is not denied, but on the other hand maximization of output per se can hardly be accepted as a sound objective, particularly in this age. Nevertheless, even from a purely economic angle, this model can be supported, if it can be proved that by adoption of the former model, the economy will move away from rather than towards the 'production possibility frontier'. It seems that under the dynamics of the former model this might well be the case due to the unemployment and social turmoil caused: the economy will operate on or near the production possibility frontier, only if it is able to absorb efficiently all the workers pushed out by the agricultural sector.  The choice of technology in this model will perforce have to be of 'biological-chemical' nature rather than of 'mechanical-engineering' type. Here it is of interest to note that 'biological-chemical' technology in West Pakistan is relatively more expensive as compared with the advanced countries. For example, in Japan it takes 2-4 lb. of wheat to buy one lb. of nitrogen, while in West Pakistan it takes more than 3 lb. of wheat to buy i lb. of nitrogen.  The operational strategy of this model is based on the selection of project areas, with a view to improving the economic position of small farmers by undertaking an intensive programme of extension, farmer education and training, supervised credit, production planning, marketing, provision of farm machinery on hire, intensification and diversification of agriculture according to optimal cropping pattern and encouraging farm co-operatives on commercial lines.  The proposed programme is built around the integrated and intensive use of a 'package of inputs and services' that wiU help cultivators achieve greater production and productivity. Basic items in the 'package' are intensive technical guidance to the farmers in planning their farm operations and management, intensive demonstration work to show the advantages and techniques involved in improved practices and new technology, provision of adequate production credit based on approved farm plans, and timely availability of needed inputs in each village.

M. AZAM 423  interesting fact to note in this connection is that Pakistani farmers have to pay only one-half of the amount of wheat which the world farmers have to pay for a tractor of equal design and power.' This paradox thus reflects in a situation in which a relatively cheap input (labour) is being replaced by a relatively dearer input (capital). The prices artificially maintained by the Government measures thus make the private marginal productivity of investment in tractors considerably higher than it is in advanced countries and higher than its marginal social productivity at home.  The dynamics of this model in the case of India has been dramatically brought into focus by Michael Lipton^ as follows:  For India's planners, the role of agriculture has been to provide surplusesof food, workers, financefor industry. This implies pushing resources to the big farmers, who will use them to increase their food sales to the cities, their savings in city banks, and probably their stock of machines to replace workers migrating to the city. In this sense the New Strategy^the policy of using the undisputed boon of improved seeds so as to benefit the big farmersis just the old urban bias in new guise. So is the exclusive emphasis on Incentives (which the big farmers can afford most easily), to the neglect of Institutions needed only by the poor.  Clearly the rich farmerthe 10 per cent of India's farmers who will get the improved seedsbenefits hugely. His output doubles, his prices fall by perhaps 15 per cent in the long term and even if his input costs rise by the same amount he is left 40 or 50 per cent richer. The townsman, rich or poor, benefits too; workers and jobless from cheaper food, employers (private or State) from the consequent easing of the pressure for wage rises. The worst-off 30 per cent of Indian agriculturistswith no land at all, or with too Httle to feed their families without doing outside workbenefit too: their food is cheaper, and their short-run job prospects better as there is extra demand for fertilizer appliers, weeders and harvesters and often double-cropping. The long-run job affects are Hkely to be harmful, as bigger and richer farmers are almost certain to seek, on an increasingly massive scale, to replace men by machines. But in the short-run all the townsmen, the richest 10 per cent of agriculturists, and the poorest 30 per cent all seem to gain.  The sufferersnot from the new seeds but from the way they are being allocatedare the middle 60 per cent of India's agriculturists, making up over 40 per cent of her people. Such men grow enough to feed their families and sell a small food surplus; they hire in more labour than they hire out; but they are  * Hiromitue ICaneda, 'Economic Implications of the Green Revolution and the Strate gy of the Agricultural Development in West Pakistan', The Pakistan Development Review, vol. ix (1969), p.127.

(vi) It is administration-intensive: executive capacity is a scarce resource in Pakistan, having a high opportunity cost.  (vii) It may also be administration-persistent: services once provided are difficult to withdraw.  (viii) A government agency entering the field of production or marketing credit has to compete with moneylenders who have certain advantages. No doubt the moneylenders charge high rates of interest but they are very responsive, have simple procedures and are able to supervise closely. Also supervised credit is very difficult for the government to administer for thousands of small farmers having no collateral.  (xi) Concentration on small farmers has a large number of disadvantages anyway; for example in respect of credit, it would unavoidably lead to a much lower loan recovery rate. It would also almost certainly lead to soft interest rates which in turn place a limit on the expansion of the credit system beyond a relatively smaller size. At the present stage of development in West Pakistan, if an investment cannot at least compound an interest rate of 12 per cent, then it is not a good investment; soft credit may encourage wrong investments.  (x) An even more serious problem in the project/package approach is that these are difficult to operationalize on the ground, e.g. in case of credit it is very difficult to eliminate the cumbersome procedures of the agricultural banks; alternatively efficiency can only be achieved at a high cost of low recoveries.  (xi) In view of scarce resources, both financial and managerial, investment on a functional basis, such as on fertilizers, improved seeds, etc., may give better results.  (xii) The various components of the package approach i.e. improvement in extension, supply of inputs, credit, marketing, etc. do not necessarily operate as a vehicle of technological change simply because they have been combined together. If the resource base of the farmers is inadequate, the package programme will not have much influence, unless some basic changes in the agrarian structure are effected.","page_count":0,"record_type":"secondary","parent_id":"p16022coll345:69542","first_viewer_type":"image","viewer_type":"image","child_index":48,"attachment":"69243.jp2","document_type":"item","featured_collection_order":999,"date_added":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","date_added_sort":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","date_modified":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"p16022coll345:69243","object":"https://cdm16022.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/getthumbnail/collection/p16022coll345/id/69243","set_spec":"p16022coll345","collection_name":"Norman E.

While the programmes initiated under the above five categories would be equally available both to the small and large farmers, it should be particularly seen that the small farmers are not left out  In the present context of West Pakistan agricultural development vts-a-vzs the current public sector resource position, we are of the view that a more relevant theoretical framework is provided by the  ShL\"\"\"\"\"\" H I\"\" of this paper.

Thus with the removal of price control on fertilizers, coupled with planned increases in the production capacity, fertilizer prices are likely to fall much below the present subsidized level, thereby reducing the credit requirements both for large and small farmers. Also by rationalization of the system of agricultural subsidies, funds can be spared for investments in areas showing greater promise.  (ii) The wheat and rice procurement organization and procedures should be streamlined so that small farmers no longer remain at a disadvantage as compared with more influential larger farmers.  (iii) The services of private sector should be utilized to the maximum in the areas of storage, marketing, and distribution of inputs, provided that in the case of subsidized inputs, a proper check is exercised on the distribution costs.  (iv) In the field of agricultural credit, a great service to agricultural sector could be rendered by private commercial banks if they would open branches in the rural areas, with a view not only to extending credit to the farmers but also to mobilize rural savings.  (v) In the field of extension, a great deal can be achieved by using cheaper extension media. In this connection, West Pakistan has already done well in reaching the small farmers through the Radio.'  In a nutshell, the formula for success in West Pakistan seems to lie in sharpening the present developmental focus on the 'biological-chemical' technology, while trying to reach the smaller farmer by increasing the efficiency and by reorienting the outlook and mission of existing institutions^ through public policies and through considered changes in the social structure of agriculture rather than by creating new elaborate institutional arrangements. Also, efforts should be made for finding a suitable technology for the barani areas.  ^ Cf. Refugio I.

The congress, held every five years and easily the most important meeting in the field, is sponsored by the International Genetic Foundation and hosted this year by the Genetic Suciety of Ainerica.  By the time it is over a week from tomorrow, more than 130 lectures and 1000 papers wlU have been delivered.  Most of them will be technical presentations, but among them are talks on genetic engineering, theinher-itability of intelligence, the impact of agricultural genetics in developing countries, and the genetic basis of dis-eace.  ''There is hardly an area of society in which genetics don't play a part,\"\" said Spencer Brown, secretary general of the congress and a Berkeley geneticist.  Easily the most controversial topic is tiie genetic basis of intelligence, and most of the controversy yesterdav swirled around a man who is not a geneticist and is not at the conference, Arthur R. Jensen.  Jensen, a n educational psychologist on the Berkeley campus in recent years, has touched off an Uproar with his theories that blaci<s score iov.-er on IQ tests than other groups because of inherited deficiencies.

The Green Revolution is an attempt to increase agricultural production by technological means, without altering the economic framework that maintains the imbalance between the rich and poor nations.  The Green Revolutionthe introduction to developing countries of high yield crop hybrids that need intensive irrigation and massive applications of pesticides and fertilizershas led to the Lroad spectrum of current and potential genetic, ecological and social problems outlined below.  Geneticists are concerned that planting huge tracts of farm land with the new hybrid strains will eliminate wild and locally cultivated forms upon which plant breeders depend to develop additional strains v.1). Furthermore, since the crop hybrids being used were selected for yield rather than broad resistance characteristics, they are highly susceptible to the continually evolving plant pests and pathogens(2). The Com Leaf Blight that occurred in the United States in 1970 has been attributed to the development and use of the susceptible T cytoplasm specific strain (1), while in the following year in the Philippines the crop of miracle rice, IR-8, was heavily damaged by tungro virus(3). These crop hybrids therefore require protection by massi-*''e amounts of pesticides which disrupt the local ecology. Also the recurrent droughts in many of these countries are especially harsh on the Green Revolution crops which require intense irrigation(4). Irrigation schemes can cause further problems such as the lowering water table in Pakistan and the changed drainage patterns which may be making flooding more severe in the Philippines(4).  Green Revolution crops are \"\"high-yield\"\" only through heavy use of expensive pesticides, fertilizers, irrigation and machines; this causes obvious economic and social problems. Estimates for both India (6) and the Philippines (5) put the total cost for the production of high yield varieties at ten times.the cost using traditional varieties and methods. Large farm owners who can afford such investments are increasing their profits and holdings, while the small farm owners who cannot afford the high costs lose their fanas and join the great mass of landless migrants as low-paid farmworkers and factory workers or drift to the overpopulated cities to swell the ranks of the unemployedX7). Laborers do not necessarily benefit from increases in production; in one area that Green Revolution methods are extensively used (Punjab, India) wages increased 50% less than the increase in production and cost of living from the early to mid or late sixties, while in a district with a strong peasants' organization and a sympathetic government, the wage increase surpassed the cost of living increase(8). Also, in contrast to the agribusiness emphasis on numerical quotas and yieldsand profitsthat can usually be achieved by the large farmers alone, one experimental program in India (Raipur district) demonstrated the importance and benefits of involving small farmers(9). Finally, the developing nations are forced into increasing economic dependence on the rich nations through the large corporations (Esso in the Philippines, for example (10)) that export the necessary  agricultural chemicals and machines.","page_count":0,"record_type":"secondary","parent_id":"p16022coll345:69542","first_viewer_type":"image","viewer_type":"image","child_index":3,"attachment":"69198.jp2","document_type":"item","featured_collection_order":999,"date_added":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","date_added_sort":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","date_modified":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"p16022coll345:69203","object":"https://cdm16022.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/getthumbnail/collection/p16022coll345/id/69203","set_spec":"p16022coll345","collection_name":"Norman E.

MONDAY, JANUARY 22. 1973  Monday, January 22, 1973  A MODERATE  rasE  rise in the Consumer Price Index, which measures movements in retail prices throughout Australia, was a comparatively moderate 1.2% in the December quarter. This implied an annual rate of inflation of almost 5%, higher than what Austraha has been used to. However, the latest movement brought the annual rate of increase for the 12 months to 4.6%, substantially less than the 7% that was recorded in the 12 months to the end of December 1971. The continuous decline in the 12-monthly rates of increase since has been encouraging. But the improvement has not been costless. Policies to counter growing inflationary pressures, which became evident towards the end of 1970, have resulted in a substantial reduction in the rate of economic growth in the past 18 months and historically high levels of unemployment.  The continued improvement in the December quarter seems to have been not entirely unexpected in official quarters. Measures to ease the rate at which economic activity was decUning were implemented late in 1971 and substantially reinforced by generous allocations to the States in June and an expansionary Budget in August. It was stated at the time of the Budget that as a result of expansionary policies the economy was expected to be growing vigorously again in the first half of 1973. Several features in the improving labour market support this forecast. The Leader of the Opposition and former Federal Treasurer, Mr Snedden, was entitled to claim credit for the improvement in the Consumer Price Index in the December quarter. It seems evident, however, that the former Government's acceptance of its economic responsibilities, with concomitant unemployment, cost it office; the observation is pertinent because the same unpleasant responsibilities are likely to confront the new Labor Government.  Statutory restraints  It has to be remembered that several months ago the Treasury pointed out on its own behalf that inflationary pressures were the result not only of excessive demand, but excessively growing costs, particularly wage costs, to suppliers. Despite the almost stagnant rate of growth of demand during the past 18 months, and the high levels of unemployment, wages have continued to grow at rates which seem to have reflected only partially the effects of the slow-down. In other words, what many people would consider the primary cause of the inflationary problems of the past two years seems not to have been removed but merely contained to resurge once full employment levels are regained.  Measures tending to raise real wages being promoted by the new Government will exacerbate the problem of containing wage increases, as will resumption of pressure supporting wage claims deferred during the election. Some of these measures include support for equal pay for women at the next National Wage Case, paid maternity leave in the Commonwealth Public Service, selective support for the 35-hour week and the trend to collective bargaining. Unless the Government is able to persuade the unions to restrain their wage claims it is certain to be faced with the problem that has faced other Western governments, the problem the previous Government shirked, that of implementing a prices and incomes policy.  Hostile union response to the Government's decision to oppose percentage wage increases in favour of flat increases in future are some indication of the problems involved. It is possible that the Government's pro-labour policies and its decision to establish a prices justification tribunal will help it to persuade the unions to participate in a system of voluntary restraint. But it is problematical, and the Government may be forced to consider a system of statutory restraints on wage increases, as other Governments have had to do. The unions must be made to appreciate the alternatives, particularly the costs involved in statutory restraints, before the choice between them becomes imperative.  The health centre concept and the ACT  A health centre is \"\"an institution wherein are brought together various medical services preventive and curative, so as to form one organisation\"\".   The Dawson Report (1920).  TN the early years of this century the health care of the community was provided at the home, the surgery and the hospital by the general practitioner. This pattern was to alter, under the influence of a number of related factors.  The rapid rise of science and tecbnology led to a greater scope for medical treatment. It was not possible for one person to be competent in all areas of medicine. The age of specialisation commenced and accelerated. Departments of Health became increasingly involved, especially in the mental and child health areas. The cost of health care continued to escalate and led to the introduction of the National Health Scheme. The hospital became the focus of health care. It also dominated medical research, medical education and health finance.  But in recent years there has arisen an awareness that although the health-care system had the necessary components to help the community, there was poor co-ordination and often duplication. It became apparent that a person with a problem had difficulty in arranging the appropriate help, on a continuing basis, at the right time and at the right place. This overall situation is called fragmentation.  The rising costs of hospital care became alarming. Examination of alternatives pointed to the advantage of prevention, in comparison to hospital-based curative procedures. Prevention meant a return to the community as the area for attention.  DUT the community had changed. Rapid urbanisation, automation, the motor car, affluence, all contributed to a new way of life. A new science emergedhuman biology  to study the impact of civilisation on the human species. A fundamental concept was that the greatest rate of change in the history of mankind was in progress and that man was experiencing mala-daptation. A new spectrum of diseases assumed increasing importance  heart disease, suicide, trauma, lung cancer, drug abuse.  Confronting this rapid change was a medical profession educated to deal predominately with diseased organs and unprepared for behavioural and sociological disorders. Reports began to point to the need for a more balanced medical education with greater emphasis on community health. There was a requirement for a \"\"doctor of  By HENRY PANG*  Health centres will he operational in Canberra this year. The idea is not new. What follows is a personal appreciation of the concept, based on a growing body of published opinion, together with impressions gained at the 5th World Conference on General Practice held in Melbourne in October 1972.  first contact\"\" who was a gen-eralist and who was capable of mobilising and co-ordinating a team. The team approach to health care was underlined.  The health centre is an innovative approach to health care delivery. It is based on team work. Selected components of the existing health-care system are brought together to work in a functionally designed building. The objective is integration in the place of fragmentation. The suggested team for the Belconnen \"\"C\"\" Health Centre has been listed (see table on this page).  Patients will continue to have free choice not only for a particular doctor, but also for service at a health centre or at an existing practice. The  effective mobilisation of the expanded health team will be designed into the centre, but these services will also be available to other practices.  These buildings will be called health centres because their orientation will be towards preventive action and the promotion of health in its widest connotation. The approach to preventive medicine will be by programs of screening well people, well-child examinations, health education (including linkage with national fitness movements) and particularly by co-ordination with the community mental health services. Encouragement will be given to the community to learn to care for itself, and to this end community representation will be avail-  THE HEALTH TEAM (BASED ON BELCONNEN \"\"C\"\" HEALTH CENTRE) Primary-Care Team (4 teams, each with 2 GPs): General practitioner General practice nurse Secretary/receptionist  Expanded Health Team:,  Dentists (4)  Community mental health services Psychiatrist Psychologist (2)  Social worker (2)  Speech therapist Health visitors Community nursing Child health services Health education Clinical facilities  Dietitian, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, radiology, pathology. Administration (including computer facilities)  able in the administration of each centre.  It is important to note that \"\"community\"\" is not synonymous with \"\"domiciliary\"\". A community-based concept refers to the orientation of purpose. The siting of each centre will be determined by a multiplicity of factors. The Belconnen \"\"C\"\" Health Centre will serve four suburbs with a population of 20,COO.  'JpHERE is no ideal catchment area, but it would not be feasible to have the team concept operative for one suburb of 4,000. In general, health centres in Canberra would logically be in group centres, in close proximity to other community facilities such as shops, occasional-care centre, library, theatre, park, and public transport. Nevertheless, there is an opportunity to evaluate different types of health centres, including mini-centres, to assess the relative effectiveness and costs.  Health centres may mean that some people will not be able to continue their present pattern of walking to a practice. However, it should be borne in mind that the siting will be a community group centre, that the maiority of people will be mobile, that a domiciliary service continues to be available in true need, and that the need for a team approach assumes a greater priority to ohysical convenience.  The implementation of this concept is not necessarily related to payment arrangements. The health centre can function effectively in the existing fee-for-service system.    The Belconnen \"\"C\"\" Health Centre. Circles indicaic approximate walking distance.  However, there is a school of thought, the most recent being the Canadian Hastings Report (1972), which believes that the full - achievement of the objectives inherent in the health-centre concept cannot occur with the present fee structure. This is because of the difficulty of defining a service in the team context. No report has been able to recommend any one payment system or any combination, and this underlines the importance of evaluating alternatives in Canberra.  ^NE of the strong impressions gained at the 5th World Conference on General Practice in Melbourne was the impact that computers would have on health-care systems. The team approach will require a sophisticated communication and information system not only for record pur-  poses, but for monitoring patterns of illness in the community, for audit of quality of service and for continuing education. The application of computers to health-care systems will introduce new insights and enhanced quality of service.  It is perhaps fitting to conclude this article with the final line of the Llewelyn - Davies' report, 'Future Health-Care Services in the ACT (1970): \"\"Canberra has the opportunity for demonstrating a consistent forward-looking approach and adding to the physical plan an advanced community oriented health-care service worthy of the physical context\"\".  * Dr Pang is a Canberra general practitioner and is a member of the Working Party, Belconnen \"\"C\"\" Health Centre.  Government homes  Sir,  With recent Federal Government  housing decision affecting the States, the stage seems set for the Labor Government to continue the \"\"rental-only\"\" policy for Canberra government houses introduced by the previous Government.  Mr Enderby should be aware by now of the difficulties and expenses imposed on both tenants and people who had been on the housing list for a long time. Many of the former have spent a lot of money on improving their homes in the expectation of buying, and the latter have paid high rentals rather than buy private enterprise houses (which have, of course, gone up in price since). Mr En-derby would also remember the public outcry against the measure and his own sympathetic though somewhat evasive, response at the time.  While not actually saying he would recommence government house sales, his statements have given most people involved the impression that he is \"\"on their side\"\" and that it was only a matter of time before they would be able to buy their houses. This is  LETTERS to the Editor^  an issue about which people feel strongly and it will become more important as the number of people affected grows.  No matter what arguments Mr Enderby or Mr Uren put up to support a \"\"rental only\"\" policy for government houses in Canberra, it will be hard to convince those adversely affected by the decision, and the Canberra population at large, that it is not just an expression of the ALP doctrine of maximising government control over the individual (in his own interests, of course).  RUSSELL WATSON HELEN WATSON Cazaly Place,  Holt.  ?   The Green Revolution  ir,  Your London correspondent Mr Barry Wilson has reported that the Green Revolution has \"\"turned sour\"\" (The Can-  berra Times, December 28, page 2), and has produced some rather nebulous evidence to support this statement.  1 must take strong issue with this assessment. I have during the past two years researched this subject across the world for the purpose of a book on the work and achievements of the so-called \"\"father\"\" of the Green Revolution, Eh\"\" Norman E. Bor-laug, the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize winner.  I must say in opposition to Mr Wilson that I have heard no voice raised in Mexico, in the Punjab or Uttar Pradesh, in Turkey, Afghanistan or Morocco or Latin America which would agree one jot with the idea that the Green Revolution has \"\"gone sour\"\".  Firstly, let me say that Mr Wilson based his text on incorrect figures and assumptions. Dr Borlaug did not double Mexican wheat yields^he increased them sevenfold.  Nigeria debates its future  THE former President of the Federal Republic . of Nigeria, Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe, delivered a lecture at the University of Lagos on October 27 last year and thereby set in motion a full-dress national debate on the constitutional future of the federation.  It was the first public debate on political and constitutional matters since 1967, when the Biafra civil war broke out.  Dr Azikiwe, who was recently appointed Chancellor of the University by the Federal Government, chose as his subject 'Nigeria after military rule: an analysis of political theory*. And he said he did bo deliberately in order to make it \"\"a talking point\"\". He was not disappointed. Almost as soon as the lecture was reported, a spate of criticisms ensued led by the country's national newspapers.  The core of Dr Azikiwe's lecture was that after 1976 Nigeria should be ruled by a diarchy of civil-cum-military government in -vhich the heads of the army, the navy, the air force and the police would have veto power on certain matters, instead of a completely civilian government.  He said, \"\"There should not b an imimediate transfer of  From L. K. JAKANDE, in Lagos, Nigeria  Speculation on the possibility of a form of military government in Papua New Guinea is invariably linked with examples of the rise of military governments in emergent nations in Africa. In this article L. K.

Azikiwe founded. In the Pilot's view, \"\"As a matter of fact, the suggestion offered by Dr Azikiwe that both the military and civilians should rule together for a period of five years after 1976 is a good suggestion which must receive the blessing of the people of this country\"\".  For four consecutive weeks, the pages of Nigerian newspapers were filled with contributions from readers. At the campuses of the various universities, in radio and television programs, and, indeed, in all public places, discussions centred on what to do in 1976 and after.  There was no doubt about the thinking of the majority of articulate Nigerians. They are opposed to a military-cum-civilian government at the end of the present military regime. They prefer to return to parliamentary government, although opinions djiTer as to the nature of the parliament and the method of Achieving the common objective.  The military rulers themselves maintained a studied silence throughout the debate, but it was widely rumoured that Dr Azikiwe b^d sent an  power to complete civilian rule: rather a modus operandi should be devised for a combined civil and military government that should rule this country, on a democratic basis, for five years, after which period the continuation of such a regime should be reviewed in the light of experience and reason\"\".  In October 1970, nine months after the bitter civil war, the Head of State, General Yakubu Gowon, announced that the military regime would not hand over power to civilians until 1976. He also issued a nine-point program which would engage his Government's attention between then and 1976. He promised that in 1976 power would be hande I over to a popularly elected government. The argument was about what should happen in 1976 and after.  ^NE of the first newspapers to criticise Dr Azikiwe's proposal was the New Nigerian, owned jointly by the six military Governments in the northern part of Nigeria. It described the proposal as \"\"facile and unconvincing, in  addition to dilutive his beloved democratic process\"\". The Nigerian Observer, also owned by a military State Government (Midwest State) said, \"\"Dr Azikiwe is confused as to the actual basis of the army's continuance in Government once their corrective measures have been sufficiently inculcated in a nation's body politic\"\".  Three of the four independent national newspapers were also critical of the proposal. The Sunday Times (which is part of the British IPC empire) declared, \"\"This suggestion is unworkable and too explosive for consideration\"\". The Daily Express protested, \"\"Zik's ill-timed, new-found philosophy is not a tribute to the truly wonderful achievements of our military leaders\"\". The independent Nigerian Tribune, in four editorials, dismissed the idea as preposterous. \"\"Dr Azikiwe's concept of democratic government must be different from the ordinary if he imagines that what he proposes is democracy\"\", it said.  The only newspaper which supported the diarchy was, understandably enough, the West African Pilot, which Dr  advance copy of his lecture to the Government. Dr Azikiwe was the President of the Republic when, in January 1966, the army seized power. He himself was out of the country at the time of the coup. It was his deputy, Dr Nwafor Orizu, who formally surrendered power.  rjR Azikiwe was the first and last President of the civilian regime and was, before then, the Governor-General, having succeeded the British representative of the Queen, Sir James Robertson. A journalist and publisher of distinction and for many years a legislator and politician, Dr Azikiwe comes from the Ibo tribe, the hard core of the ill-fated Biafran rebellion. The doctor at first sided with the rebels and went as far as to compose the National Anthem of the Republic of Biafra. But he fell out with the Biafran leader, Odumegwu Ojukwu, in 1969 and crossed to the Federal side less than a year before the rebellion collapsed.  Dr Azikiwe, in a rebuttal of the criticisms, summed up his reasons for the suggested diarchy as follows: the steady  decline of civilised government in Africa; the inability of most African governments to guarantee their citizens freedom from want; and tl emergence of what appears to be odd characteristics among some rulers in Africa, some of whom cling to power for life and some of whom indulge in barbaric acts against their citizens, such as cutting off their arms or ears.  But his critics sav that all these reasons do not justify the continuation of military rule in any shape or form from 1976. It is a debate which will continue most probably for the next four years.  The program of the Military Government provides for the setting up of a constituent assembly for drawing a new constitution, the establishment of new political parties (the old ones have been banned and cannot be revived), and the holding of elections. A high-powered board has been created to supervise a nationwide census of the population which will be held in November 1973. The census report will form the basis for the delimitation of constituencies for the 1975 or 1976 elections.  There are, f course, genuine fears about the smooth transition from military to democratic rule. It is argued by the doubters that military regimes tend to perpetuate themselves in office. But many Nigerians are optimistic that  Gowon will keep his promise^ whatever happens.  He made the (then) population of Mexico (1956) self-sufficient in grain production. The dwarf wheats he and his team bred increased yields in the irrigation areas of India and Pakistan at least sevenfold and up to tenfold in places.  Your correspondent says the Green Revolution has been around for \"\"a decade or more\"\". This is not true  and the point is important since the number of generations of new strains of wheat plants must go with the seasons  and one needs little reminding that in 1966-67 in two years of drought in India and Pakistan were close to widespread famine from which they were saved by the most massive food rescue effort in history, when fleets of ships from America, Canada and Australia poured millionsi of tons of grain into those over-burdened ports. Less than 10 years ago, we should recall, 3 million people died of hunger in the State of Bengal alone. Now, sir. Let me remind you that Dr Norman Borlaug spoke the first public assessment of the coming Green Revolution in Canberra  in the Academy of Science in August 1968; and I can personally assure you that there were few people then who listened to his words.  Mr Wilson writes of \"\"more rats than ever before in India\"\", offered presumably as part of a case against the Green Revolution. We have, periodically, had plagues of mice in this country. Should we then stop producing food for our people?  His text produces a comment from some obscure UN official that \"\"social problems\"\" have been created. Of course! On the Indian sub-continent it became fashionable to say that without the Green Revolution there would have been a Red Revolution.  Nearly 90% of those 600-million people are agrarian, mostly peasant farmers. Now they no longer have to take food from their mouths to buy a piece of cotton cloth for their backs. They have money to spend on other things, such as transistors which give them contact with the outside world.  They have sunk, fiiemselves, a quarter of a million bores to tap the first clean, fresh water many of them ever saw. The water buffalo pond which served communal needs is no longer used by millions of people who now ask: Where are our roads, our schools, our hospitals?  Social problems? No wonder Indian and Pakistani officials are worried. But they no longer hold out feeding bowls to the rest of the world in supplication! Despite the figures given by Mr Wilson in his article, in less than five years Pakistan became self-sufficient in grain production and India raised her total production for the first time to more than 100 million tons.  the Iron Curtain. The greatest enemy to the success of the new food outlook is human procreation, the menacing doubling of human numbers.  Dr Borlaug has reasoned that while population expands, land areas remain static: e.g. land must be encouraged to produce more nutritious food. The Green Revolution has given, by his claim, no more than 20-30 years of breathing space; thus he has turned the Green Revolution team in Mexico to breeding new plants which produce high levels of protein.  The great menace for 1,000 million of the world's children is protein deficiency, which, if suffered in the first 18 months of life has effects which are irreversible. It is a great human tragedy that these hundreds of millions will never reach their full genetic potential.  The Green Revolution, far from turning sour, has crossed genetic barriers the pundits said would never be crossed. It has produced the first man-made grain plant, the first new cereal in 10,000 years of agriculture.  Some of these grains in Mexico give lysine and amino acid building blocks for protein levels equal to milk, cheese, butter. The first experiments with animals show wonderful recuperative results.  Far from turning sour, the Green Revolution, which sprang from Dr Borlaug's original work in Mexico and which he has implemented in many lands, is, in fact, just starting to bear a greater harvest than wm dreamed of only five years ago.

That afternoon 1 learned at least about the first part of Norman Borlaug's contribution to tlje Green Revoluuon. Through the years, and incorporating (as he would insist on my saying) the work ot many dedicated wheat breeders, he changed wheat from a tall plant with a fragile stem, which would fall down in the wind and rain, to a thick-stemmed, heavv-headed dwarf which would convert irrigation water and intensive chemical fertili/.atiun into grain instead of taller straw. . He bred into it resistance to rust and other parasites, and though this had certainly been done before, found a remarkably simple way of beating evolution. Wheat rust is capable of mutating annually,. all by itself so that a wheat which has been resistant one year may be susceptible to a new mutant rust the next. But in Mexico, Dr. Bor-laug realized, he could produce two crops of new seed a year by simply taking advantage of the fact that there are two geographicallv distinct growing seasons, one in Sonora, the Mexican wheat belt, and the other near Toluca. which is much higher and has dilTerent rainfall and temperature patterns.  \"\"We've got to keep moving,\"\" he said, as he explained that to me. \"\"'We can't stand around and preen like peacocks while the sky is falling.\"\"  Most recondite, and most imptjrtant in its world implications, has been Dr. Borlaug's breedini! into the new wheats a quality called\"\" \"\"davlength in-sensitivity.\"\" Thus the highly productive, disease-resistant varieties may be used at many latitudes and altitudes, regardless of the hours-per-day of sunlight, so that there is no time-consiiniin<: need for developing special wheals for each localitv.  What goes on, then, lirst at I\\iluca, then with the Toluca seed at Si.)nora. then with the Sonitra seed back again, is that 45fXI to 5000 new seed-producing varieties are planted and tested, and the best of them put into production for seeds to be shipped around the world cver\\ year. The breeding, the very first step in producing all this, is a kind of sacrament. Mere is how vou do it;  Choose a plant ol ripe wheat which pleases \\ou. in lineage and mdiviilual t|u:iliiy, and sit by it. Carelully open each kernel ot die head, probiiiii in with needle-nosc l\\\\ee/,ers, anil remove ihe little male parts, discarding llieni ealmg them, e\\en. il unconsciously you are nuued to. Now. with vcr\\  sharp scissors, cut the top from the ease which encloses each of these newly emasculaiod kernels, rendering the whole head green, exp. ised, moist, and sticky. You must cover it-her now -with a little glassine envelope, and clip the eiuelope at the bottom with a paper clip, for in this .ondition wild pollen might tind her before the mate is ready.  Choose a head of wheat from another plant, robust, of complementary ancestry, and cut it off with a short section of stem. Again with the tweezers, take out the female parts this time from each kernel, and again shear oil\"\" the top of each encasement.  You have just created male and female.  Stand the male in the sun, or, if the miti he weak, circle him with the warmth of vc.iir ..ands, taking care not to touch. In a moment he will begin to swell visibly, and yellow hlamenls will push out of each opened sheath. Quickly: cut the top off the glassine envelope which shields the female. Blow it open into a cylinder. Holding him by the stem, turn the male upside down, and thrust him completely into the envelope. Rotate, swirl, shake and in a moment a cloud of yellow pollen ^ emit millions of fertile spores, tilling the t-clinging to the receptive female. She tv nrcu.  It takes only one spore to feriili/t. Throw the male aside. Fold the top of the envelope down. Put on a paper clip.  1\"\"^ he following morning I had breakfast with the Borlaugs at their home in the Lomas. an upper-middle-class residential secijiMi of Mexico City, and we talked of Minne.sota and the Depression.

But I don't think Norman Bcirlaug realized we were there, lie had barely begun speaking his views, alter the prize was awarded, before the hotheads began to attackas. indeed, some of them had before then. And he came out of his Me.xican corner, as 1 should have known he would, with the puckered grin and his arms ready to grab hold and wrestle.  The occasion of our .second meeting, in 1971, was the dedication, in Oesco, of a monument to Dr. Borlaug. and 1 heard, in his acknowledgment speech, a brief and not very careful version of what he'd been saying. Again, I'll summarize, and take responsibility I'or it: environmentalists were attacking farmers, who were his people, and he wouldn't stand for it. Thev were scientific halfwits, callous to human sutfering. seltish in- their demands for an environment which would serve chied) their personal pleasure. They were dangerous radicals.  I didn't, and still don't, know what his political inclinations are. It did seem clear that he was not aware that the conservation movement here is a wild political coalition of the far right with middle-class liberals of both parties; the allluent voung with the deprived old; intellectuals with out-doorsmen; suburban consumers, who have little idea what it will cost them in increased rates and prices, with our purest romantic.s, the hippie.s, who don't care, it is only a secondary cause to most radicals, who are suspicious of the accompanying population control proposals.  V\\ hat 1 wanted to tell Dr. Borlaug was that the people he was counterattacking included, alonii with the cranks, most of his natural allies in the fight against the terrible, underlving problem of population glut, and that he might disregard the shrill and the embittered among them ajid lind many people with that common sense he holds .so precious.  Mostly, though, I wished he could talk with .some American farmers-my neighborsin whose delense he felt he was speaking, for the Green Revolution began with their fathers and erand-tathers-inen who sent tiieir sons ti.) agricultural school, and then pi(>neered chemical fertilization and new seeds, mechanized farming, and chemical control of weeds and insects. I hev made America,  as 1 had to move to Iowa to learn, as much a great agricultural as a great industrial country, and those who are farming today are proud of that. They are, 1 contend, a more concerned and knowing group than either Dr. Borlaug or the conservationist-politicians realize.  To take the four neighbors I named to begin with (and 1 didn't set it up this way): Earlis Rohret concedes readily that meat raised naturally is of better flavor and texture than the pork he suppliesbut he will also add that the pressure on him is to achieve acceptable quality and very high quantity at low cost; he feels strongly and directlv a responsibihty to keep this country fedmeanwhile, the condition in which he keeps his non-farmable land is a joy to see. Orval Yoder, who has probably been more inconvenienced than ans-one else by my resisting the paving of our road, since he takes care of the vehicles that use it, ha> nevertheless been my ally in trying to get the county engineer to rechannel the creek for road-building in a way that will preserve water quality, though it would be more costly. Mac McKinney, before he bought the tavern, was raising 160-bushel-to-the-acre corn, but he was also planting all his fencerows to wildlife cover, though to do so loses the space for additional rows of grain. And Bob Asquith, the Soil Conservation Service technician, has been selling and engmeenng soil-and-water-conservation practices all his professional life. To any of these men, food production is obviously the basic job, and they are as proud of the way they do it (maybe with more reason) as Detroit is of its cars. Nor do 1 know a single farmer out here who isn't eager to learn, and even trv' experimentally on his own'to discover, those ways of supplying the national need which least damage the land they live on and love.  I didn't get a chance to say those things to Dr. Borlaug at the gathering in Cresco. Though we greeted one another with some affection and managed to have a drink together, our attempts at conversation were pretty constantly interrupted bv old friends of his, and by a couple of anxious Madison Avenue men, employed by the chemical industry, who'd been following his speeches, hoping he'd become a soothing, respectable spokesman. 1 was almost sympathetic with them; they had a tiger by the tail. 'I hey wanted to hear him say moderate stuff no le.ss than 1 did, though tor them tact would only be a tactic.  But what 1 really wanted was a good deal more than moderation. I wanted to be inspired, 1 guess; 1 wanteil him to turn his back on the hotheads, and start nettins us sunrise optimists together again.

Glenn Anderson  In looking aiiead at the Green Revolution I will attempt to view dispassionately what has been accomplished, what can be expected of it and what cannot be expected to accrue from this technological advance.  THE POPULATION PROBLEM  At the present rate of increasing growth, world population is expected to be at least 6 million  but more likely will be seven  by the end of the century if projections are made of the trend.  In the areas where food production technology will provide food for the population, the increase in population is following a decreasing trend. In the areas where both technology and land availability are lacking, the population increase is at its greatest. Failure to solve this problem and control numbers will endanger the survival of the species and Malthus' prediction will be fulfilled. Most writers refer to Malthus' hypothesis as \"\"gloomy\"\"; I call it realistic. With the development of reason and invention of tools and the immense aid of agriculture, later control of disease and social development, man has increasingly controlled nature and its diminishing effects. This is the basis of his real predicament: one could say that without the full application of reason, man will have to pay up for his failure to obey the fundamental law of nature  compliance with environment  when the bill finally comes due. One could also say that the question is not if the Malthusian principle will come true but when. Some writers take the view that the world can continue to provide food for up to 45 billion people. I say this is 'hogwash' and the sooner we disabuse ourselves of this concept, the sooner we will get on the right track and control our numbers.  The green revolution infers the use of a new set of crop varieties and a package of improved technological practices. For example, the Mexican experience led to a modest spread of wheat varieties  i    m    and technology to L. tin America. It encouraged a similar experiment in rice which ha< ultimately benefited many co ntries, particularly in South an> South East Asia. Wheat technoli, gy was also extended to South Asi and later to East and North Africi with some notable results. India' production rose from a pre-gree i revolution level of 12.3 million ton record crop in 1965 to a 1972 high of 26.5 million, somewhat more than double. Rice advances were dramatic in the Phi) ppines, Indonesia, Korea and othsr countries under the influence of shorter, more responsive varie ies.  THE NEED  The exploitation of land (expansion) can proceed for some time in certain countri ;s of Latin America, the Soviet Jnion and parts of North America and Africa. The rest of the world has little expansion ro )m left so that the food expansion must be vertical (more prcduction/ hectare/year).  In 1971, cereal production in the world reached an all tine high of 1,106 million tons. In spite of the  massive dimensions of this yearly production, with a shortfall of only 42 million tons in 1972, the market was fully disrupted. The percentage difference was 3.8 percent. Yet this used up almost all the reserves available. Are we or are we not close to the wire? In addition, there are about 77 million more people each year. At present consumption rates for people and animals, this represents a need for 27 million more tons. Is it any wonder that responsible scientists say we will have to move ever more rapidly to direct consumption of cereals rather than animal products since the conversion rate is 8;1 for beef, 5:1 for pork and 2:1 for poultry?  THE MOVES TO ALLEVIATE FOOD SHORTAGE  In its present crisis, the world has certain advantaged areas such as the U.S., Canada, Australia and Argentina where food can for the foreseeable future be supplied to their populations. They have the further advantage of relatively low birth rates.

Finally there are those extreme cases such as India, Bangladesh, Egypt and Indonesia that have already passed the peril mark and birth rates are still high. These countries differ in their reasons for peril. All three countries are capable of expanding food production very materially but this can only be done in the first two by massive increase in fertilizer use, multiple cropping and further exploitation of groundwater. Any year now, India and Bangladesh could lose as many as 100 million people to famine. It may take this type of calamity to force the governments of the world to enforce population control.  All governments are short of money and it is on those things which are most pressing that moneys are expended. Countries, therefore, have traditionally given first priority to the purchase of military hardware to defend their borders. For this reason lesser developed countries can spend $26 billion on armaments each year but cannot find $2.8 billion for fertilizer plants.  lor Iniemational Developmeni  WHAT TOOLS DO WE HAVE?  The increase of food supplies will largely result from vertical increase  more production/hectare/year. This cannot be accomplished in any other way than through the massive input of fertilizers, extension of irrigation and drainage, multiple cropping, the increase of technological knowledge and its application.  QUANTITY OF FOOD  The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT), through association with national programs, is in a unique position to receive germ-plasm from many countries. The germplasm are incorporated in our next sown nurseries, evaluated, and the more promising immediately incorporated into our breeding program in which more than 5,000 crosses are effected in wheat each year. In return successful materials are distributed to National Programs and selected under their environments. The best are recirculated to our program for further crossing.  Another program with which we have recently become involved is  crossing between winter and spring wheats. This program involves three institutions  CIMMYT, Oregon State University and the Turkey National Program.  The spring wheat side is conducted principally at CIMMYT where we expect to get added genes for yield from the winter wheat and greater drought tolerance. We also expect to select from these crosses a variety of maturity dates which will permit greater flexibility in matching varieties more closely to the needs of specific conditions of growth.  On the winter wheat side, most varieties are lacking in disease resistance primarily for the rusts. Spring wheats excel in this feature and resistance can be readily transferred. Similarly the yield potential should be enhanced through crosses between these unrelated and seldom crossed populations.  Short statured Russian wheats are being successfully grown over wide areas of the winter wheat regions of Turkey, Iran and Afghanistan.  Stability of yield is of great importance. For the most part lack of stability is the result of variations in climate, weed control and associated cultural practices, and the depredation of periodic cycles of disease.  The weed problem extending throughout North Africa and the Near and Middle East is of prime concern. In the North African region we are endeavoring to introduce a forage legume-wheat system similar to that operated in dry areas of Australia. It reduces weeds and at the same time provides much enhanced forage for an animal-cereal operation and nitrogen for the succeeding grain crop. The general introduction of such techniques in this region could increase the cereal production by at least one-third and probably by one-half in many areas.  Stability in the control of insects is of fairly minor importance in wheat as compared to most crops. Breeding work and cultural practices must be provided as control measures.  Stability in the control of disease is extremely important. It is even more important when a good technological package of fertility is employed. Our program, in common with others, places great emphasis on producing resistant"},{"id":"p16022coll345:69443","object":"https://cdm16022.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/getthumbnail/collection/p16022coll345/id/69443","set_spec":"p16022coll345","collection_name":"Norman E.

Another method for control is to introduce alien germ-plasm from wheat relatives into wheat.  We are placing considerable emphasis on the multiline approach enunciated by Borlaug and others many years ago. At CIMMYT we are building a multiline in the varieties derived from cross 8156. These varieties have the prerequisite of very wide adaptation and inherent resistance to such diseases as mildew and the smuts as a group. In developing multiline varieties we feel confident that rusts can be held at bay.  In expanding the quantity of food, the 'multiple cropping' system is very feasible in the tropics and sub-tropics, provided fertilizer and water are available. In Taiwan, in the Philippines and in certain parts of India, I know of as many as five crops being taken each year on small areas of land by interplanting succeeding crops between rows of the growing crop before it is harvested. Thus when harvest comes over vast areas of the subcontinent, rice and wheat are taken in rotation and a short season crop may be grown between these two seasons. The concept, however, is summed up in the maximization of production through increased kilograms/hectare/year.  QUALITY AND NUTRITION  In the lesser developed nations, farmers make up 50-80 percent of the population. There is some variation in food to balance diets: for example, maize and beans in Mexico or wheat and rice with chickpea, pigeonpea or lentils in India. But the diet is cereally based for animal products are often scarce. Further, the cereals are consumed largely at source under primitive preparation. Additives, therefore, are out of the question except in urban centers. It is imperative under these conditions to raise the nutritional level of the cereals which provide the bulk of caloric and protein intake.  The nutritional value of the gene opaque-2 was discovered in maize in 1%5 by a graduate student Lynn Bates at Purdue University. Incorporation of this in maize essentially doubles lysine and tryptophane. Progress has been slow since that time in putting this gene in commercial hybrids or varieties but Colombia has released material with this component. CIMMYT scientists  are developing composite materials with a hard endosperm using modifying genes and are meeting with fairly rapid success. Yields are also being brought into line. Popularization of these materials in commercial production in Latin America and Africa can vastly raise the nutritional intake of both people and the animals which they raise.  Recently, Swedish workers have identified genes for high lysine in barley. Additional genes have been isolated in a mutation program in Denmark and still further natural occurring genes have been screened from varieties at Montana State University. CIMMYT is attempting to develop high yielding, disease resistant varieties incorporating genes for high lysine in both hulled and hulless types. Since the areas where barley is grown constitute areas of greatest human deprivation, we feel that high lysine barleys can materially improve their lot.  Triticale, the first man-made cereal arising from crosses of wheat x rye, also offers very interesting nutritional possibilities. Breeding work is being vigorously pursued in a joint program of CIMMYT and the University of Manitoba with financing supplied by the Canadian International Development Agency and the International Development Research Centre of Canada.  Similar opportunities exist for improving sorghum which is of such primary importance as a cereal for drought-plagued dryland areas.  At CIMMYT in collaboration with Lynn Bates at Kansas State University, we are investigating the possibilities of making wide crosses among the various grass genera. In this program the plants are treated with chemicals prior to flowering to help overcome sterility barriers so that pollen of one genus can effect fertilization of another. Our preliminary results indicate that rye x barley and barley x wheat crosses can be made. We are attempting sorghum X maize and hope to cross rice and wheat.  THE FERTILIZER AND CHEMICAL SITUATION  If we are to fully use the land surface in production, we will have to feed the plants so that they may make full use of the supply of water and solar energy. Let me em-  phasize there is no alternative. Assuming the need is great, where do we get the supplies?  Nitrogen can be produced by a number of methods which include the use of natural gas, naptha, fuel oil, coal or compression from the air. Fossil fuel, however, is exhaustible and it is likely that the power and fuel needs of the world will force man eventually to turn to the air as a source for nitrogen.  Phosphate is undoubtedly the world's most exhaustible needed fertilizer. The quantities available are finite although some believe it can profitably be mined from the continental shelf and the sea. Phosphorus, however, remains on the critical list when viewed from the standpoint of the long term need.  Fortunately, potash is in fairly high supply in many of the soils of the earth so its need as a fertilizer is correspondingly reduced. Supplies in Canada are very large.  Ewell forecasts that fertilizer use on a nutrient basis will increase from the 1970-71 figure of 68.2 million tons to 133.5 million tons in 1980-81. This means a growth rate of 7.1 percent each year for the decade. The actual growth rate in consumption was 8.8 percent in each year from crop year 1964/65 to 1970/71: during this period, the Ewell paper shows that the growth rate in the use of nitrogen in developed countries was 10.1 percent and in developing countries 16.7 percent; similar figures for phosphate are 5.2 percent and 14.7 percent and for potash, 6.6 percent and 14.7 percent.  If the world is to eat and be clothed, these tools cannot be removed. There has been a growing lobby of environmentalists  in ignorance of even the basic concepts of food production or biology  who proclaim the disadvantages of the use of protective chemicals in food and fibre crops.  The use of fertilizers is also in jeopardy from the claims of a few people that it is causing pollution in streams and rivers. This is nearly impossible if one knows anything of the action of nitrogen in the soil.  Suffice it to say that these people will change their tune when the food basket price rises inexorably as a result of their activity.

With the fresh water available, Canada and the U.S. could no doubt irrigate substantial tracts. This would mean, however, a massive financial input in moving water across the continent.  Any new irrigation schemes must include drainage if production is to be sustained. Groundwater development has added substantial areas to the irrigated acreage of the subcontinent. Care should be taken to employ it judiciously and on crops which will give the greatest return in production.  POWER NEEDS  Power has become an essential in developed countries. Mechanization in the longer term is necessary since we are increasingly short of land. In the agro-industry sector, immense power is required to fuel the various manufacturing processes, be they the manufacture of fertilizers, the making of machines, the pumping of water, the transport of agricultural products, or others.  Where is all this power to come from? Electric power produced from any form of energy could conceivably power cars, trains and other land transport. Assuming that our industrial activities were harnessed to electrical energy, where would we produce it and how? As a -first choice, hydro energy should be employed wherever possible since it is cheap. Coal burning thermal plants could be operated at pit heads and the electrical energy transmitted to other parts of the country; but this would raise the smog problem outside the cities. In the long term there seems no recourse but to use fission-generated energy and, when it is available, fusion-generated energy. Each of these is based on inexhaustible fuel.  GOVERNMENT POLICIES  Governments have a tendency to look for the easy way out and the simple solution. In this they are often misled.  If we are to produce adequate food even in the short term, we must have forward-looking, sustained governmental policies, both from the economic and organizational standpoints. In agricultural organization, governments will have to give concrete support to agricultural research and extension. It has been my experience that this is given a much  too low priority. In many other countries there are virtually no scientists and very little investment in their development. Governments must remedy this as early as possible. In so doing, they are going to have to look for superior people. There is no room for mediocrity in the race for survival.  The developed nations must assist in providing education for a cadre of people to take over the manning and leadership within the lesser developed nations.  The first assumption that must be made if productivity is to increase, is that the farmer must make a profit. This can be achieved by lowering the cost of production through higher yields, lowering the costs of inputs, raising the price of products, protecting the crop against loss, or providing markets and transport. Without some combination of these factors, virtually nothing will happen.  A stable fioor price announced well before seeding will allow the farmer to decide what level of expenditure he will incur and still have an assurance of a reasonable return.  Credit to buy inputs is a two-edged policy. Credit at reasonable rates can encourage the small farmer to use inputs. I think it does, if the institutional credit  government backed  is given with a minimum of red tape.  Land tenure in many countries works against production. In a system where the landlord takes half or, in one case of which I have knowledge, as much as 75 percent of the tenant's crop, one cannot look for much increase in the use of inputs unless the landlord provides it  and this rarely happens. Land reform in many countries is long overdue if better production is to be realized.  Storage is essential to preserve the crop once it is grown but this is unlikely to be built at market centres in anticipation of increased yields. On-farm storage is probably of greater importance since such a large part of the produce of developing countries is stored and consumed at the farm level.  Associated with marketing is the question of market access. In many countries very good highways have been constructed between main centres but at the same time there are virtually no access roads.  I would recommend to the governments of all the LDC's that they seriously consider developing  a fertilizer manufacturing capacity as a means to supply fertilizer to their farmers at a lower price and at the same time increase their foreign exchange earnings.  Each government should plan forward to increase the effectiveness of its country's water supply. This includes irrigation, cultural practices and efficient use.  I have not mentioned supply of high quality seed as one of the essential inputs. It is fair to say, however, that the major bottleneck in successful seed production occurs at the link between the experiment station and the seed production unit.  On the international scene there is a real need for governments collectively to set up international granaries of food in strategic locations so that food shortages from weather vagaries can be met expeditiously to avert famine. It is not the responsibility of exporting countries to maintain such granaries, but should be the responsibility of all countries under some international body such as the U.N. These granaries should not take the place of buffer stocks established within national boundaries.  I should not like to be classed as a prophet of doom. The situation on the food front is serious. The situation on the population front is infinitely more serious because it involves the general deterioration of the environment of the human race in broad terms. I am confident that given the necessary support and decisions we can meet the food needs for the near and medium term. It would be an enigma without parallel if man, the greatest of the animals and the one animal with reason, should be the one who is unable to solve the single problem of his numbers. If he does not, political chaos is likely to ruin him before he starves to death.  I have faith that his reason will prevail in the end and instead of an ever-expanding market concept we will redivert our energies to making the world a better place in which to live.

Additional tests to determine the size of the crack in the tab at the time of sale, as well as tests which would reveal the final failure of cracked tabs under operating conditions, were both feasible and desirable in the evaluation of such an inherently close technical question.  The Seriated Trial  We have emphasized the responsibility of the expert to assess realistically the physical evidence that he is asked to examine, and to communicate elTec-nvely the realities of his technological investigation. For the technologist to accomplish this, however, the litigation process in product liability trials must be altered so that this new role of the technical expert is encouraged. It should be possible to structure a product  trial so that the questions related to product Integrity and technical causation are treated apart from the other issues of liability. Jn cases where these questions could be considered and resolved by the jury independent of issues of injury and damages, an altered trial format would isolate and clarify these issues. Specifically, a trial format which we have termed \"\"seriated\"\" would have the jury answer the questions of technical causation and product defect before the specific injury and its consequences arc introduced (6). This is but one example of how the legal community might be brought to respond to technological realities.  Conclusion  The refinement of the product liability litigation process requires a continuing substantive dialogue between the legal and technical communities. The common problem-solving orientation of the two disciplines bodes well for such interaction. We have shared in the exciting beginnings of this legal-technical interaction (7) and hope that in the field of product liability such joint eiTorts will lead to a more sophisticated and technologically sound litiga-  tion process, one in which the technologist can be true to himself while operating within a strong and responsive adversary system.

The Green Revolution, a Western-style package of agricultural practices designed to bring about such a transformation, succeeded beyond expectation when introduced into India and Pakistan in 1967. But since its heady early progress, the revolution has run into technical problems and into sometimes bitter criticism that, far from breaking the chains of rural poverty, it has left poor farmers worse off than before. The latest blow is the  20 DECEMBER 1974  energy crisis which has raised, sometimes beyond reach, the prices of the fertilizer, fuel, and pesticides on which the new techniques depend for much of their superiority.  A major impediment to assessing the present state of the Green Revolution is the rhetoric that has accreted round it. Academic writers often attribute the overblov^n slogans to journalists. In fact they were helped into currency by the foundations and aid organizations trying to promote the new techniques. The term ''Green Revolution\"\" was coined by William S. Gaud, a former administrator of the Agency for International Development (AID). Before  the term became unfashionable, the marvels* of '^miracle wheal\"\" wx-re loudly proclaimed by the Rockefeller Foundation which, together with the Ford Foundation, supported the early work on wheat in Mexico and on rice in the Philippines.  The new agricultural techniques were oversold and, in general, overbought, by governments as well as journalists. Until the bad harvests of 1972, countries such as India and the Philippines believed they would soon attain self-sufficiency in food production, and economists fretted that exportable surpluses would send grain prices plummeting. These hopes were excessive, and the Green Revolution has failed to live up to them. After the initial overselling, the counter-reaction has been equally extreme. \"\"The Green Revolution is a hoax,\"\" states Marvin  * Under the heading \"\"Miracle in Wheat,\"\" for example, a Rockefeller Foundation report of 1969 mentions that introduction of the new wheat varieties into India \"\"has increased yields up to sevenfold.\"\" The average yield of Green Revolution btrams m India in 1968/69 was 3.49 limes that of traditional varieties.  1093"},{"id":"p16022coll345:69458","object":"https://cdm16022.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/getthumbnail/collection/p16022coll345/id/69458","set_spec":"p16022coll345","collection_name":"Norman E.

At the moment, the controversy consists of a war of words on two fronts. One front is in Washington. There, the CLW, which raised $336,500 for 17 Senate candidates during 1973 and 1974, is engaged in a dispute with the oflice of Secretary of the Senate Francis R. Valeo, who is responsible for supervising Senate campaigns for compliance with the Federal Election Campaign Act of 197L The CLW is taking issue with a determination by Valeo's officc in October that called for some preelection disclosures not previously required.  The other front is in North Dakota, where, at this writing, the race between Senator Milton Young, the Republican incumbent, and William Guy. a former Democratic governor, is still undecided pending a recount (Young had a 177-vote edge on the initial count). In the last month of the campaign. Guy found himself under heavy attack for having accepted a total of over $27,000 in checks from some 2000 CLW supporters without disclosing from the outset the council's role in soliciting the checks and \"\"bundling\"\" them for delivery. Ironically, one of those raising the issue of disclosure was an independent candidate, James R. Jungroth, a former state chairman of the North Dakota Democratic party who had himself once sought CLW support but failed to get it.  Despite the fact that disclosure of the CLW's intermediary role in fund-raising had not been legally required.  several North Dakota newspapers hit Guy hard on this issue. For instance, the Fargo Forum, noting that Guy had pledged not to accept money from '\"\"special interest groups,\"\" gave him a \"\"high hypocrisy rating.\"\"  For his part, Guy, although he had authorized the CLW to solicit funds on his behalf, expressed surprise at the amount of money he received from council supporters. On 22 October, Guy made the following comments to a television intervievr'cr in Bismark, N.D.  When we started our campaign in January we decided we would accept con-Iributions only from individuals. . . . And we also said we would welcome endorsements by responsible groups, but no money. . . . That is, no block grant from any special interest group . . . because then the membership of that special interest organization would be denied the individual choice that I think they should have.  We've followed that policy very closely. ... In each instance we've said that this endorsement will be accepted only if it carries no commitment whatsoever, and no organizational financial support. But if your members want to support us, fine. . . . And this is the way it has worked. I didn't realize that more than 1600 Americans from all over the country would send me money as members of the Council for a Livable World. . . .  The lines were drawn in the Washington controversy when the CLW chose not to follow the determination by Valeo's office on 18 October that it should make public disclosure prior to the November election of the sums raised for Senate candidates. Indeed, council leaders and their attorney, Terry F. Lenzner, formerly assistant chief counsel for the Senate Watergate Investigations Committee, have not even conceded that there has been such a ruling.  They contcnd that the only thing  the council had received was a \"\"'preliminary\"\" interpretation by Valeo's staff of disclosure requirements, and that no binding ruling on disclosure had been issued by the secretary's office a diflicult position to maintain inasmuch as the staff determination was approved by Valeo himself. According to Orlando B. Potter, consultant to the secretary on election campaign matters, \"\"He [Valeo] reacted very emphatically, and said that the council was accountable under the [1971] act and had to make the disclosures we were requiring.\"\"  The council has never tried to conceal from the general public the identities of the candidates chosen to benefit from its fund-raising efforts. With mailings to \"\"supporters\"\"or previous contributorsgoing out to some 32,.S00 persons, secretiveness would be impossible even if it were desired. But, as to preelection disclosure of the results of CLW solicitations, the council has left this to the discretion of the candidates themselves.  The president of the CLW, William Von E. Doering. a Harvard chemistry professor, has offered two principal arguments in support of the council's position.  One is that, as a group devoted not merely to fund-raising but also to advising senators on arms control issues through lobbying and seminars, the CLW could be hurt should its support for candidates become an issue in elections. This argument seems curious in light of the fuss that arose in North Dakota not from early disclosure but partly from the absence of it.  The other argument is that disclosure may make trouble for some CLW supporters whose donations are large enough (over $100) to be reported by name and who live or work in a place where arms control issues happen to be intensely controversial. In states where right-wing political factions tend to be strong, the CLW is often falsely accused of championing '\"\"unilateral disarmament.\"\" Thus, in Doer-ing's view, mandatory disclosure could constitute an infringement on an in-  10%  SCIENCE, vol.. 186"},{"id":"p16022coll345:69373","object":"https://cdm16022.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/getthumbnail/collection/p16022coll345/id/69373","set_spec":"p16022coll345","collection_name":"Norman E.

One USDA report did, however, summarize such information for wheat from 1966 to 1970 for India, West Pakistan, and Turkey.It revealed that:  - The hyv yields were substantially above local varieties - from 1.77 to 3.70 times as great.  - As the area planted to hyv's expanded, their yield levels dropped, though not evenly.  - As the hyv area expanded, the national yield levels increased.","page_count":0,"record_type":"secondary","parent_id":"p16022coll345:69542","first_viewer_type":"image","viewer_type":"image","child_index":182,"attachment":"69377.jp2","document_type":"item","featured_collection_order":999,"date_added":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","date_added_sort":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","date_modified":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"p16022coll345:69375","object":"https://cdm16022.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/getthumbnail/collection/p16022coll345/id/69375","set_spec":"p16022coll345","collection_name":"Norman E.

Effect on Quantity of Production  The hyv's have both direct and indirect effects on production.  a. Direct Effect on Output  In assessing the impact of the hyv's, some observers merely look at trends in total wheat or rice production in a particular LDC.

National statistics, however, suggest that this is not the case in India and West Pakistan.Calculation of the total per capita supply of protein from I962 to 1972 indicate that aside from a dip during the poor crop years of the 1960's, the supply has remained relatively constant in India and increased slightly in West Pakistan.

This is the case in a recent study in Uttar Pradesh;  The coming of the new technology has freed the small farmer from the less profitable cropping patterns on which he could always depend to provide minimum quantities of such staples as wheat and animal fodder for home consumption. If he grows high-yielding varieties, the small farmer can supply his home consumption needs and still have land remaining to grow high-yielding cereals for market or other high-profit crops like sugar cane. 3^  To take these and other effects into account, we should increasingly  turn our attention from yields per crop to yields per hectare per year  in Asia,  2.

Substitution for Traditional Varieties  Hyv's in large part replace traditional varieties of the same grain. Some nutritionists have wondered if the new varities,  because of their high yields, are comparable in nutrient value. This, it turns out, is a very complex matter and is not amenable to concise discussion. In the case of protein, there may not be a great deal of difference.-^ The precise answer, however, depends on an involved interplay of genetic makeup, both quantity and timing of nitrogen fertilizer applications, and environmental factors such as temperature and length of growing season.  Some varieties of corn have been developed which are cleaxly superior in lysine levels, but often these qualities are offset by lower yields or unfavorable product characteristics. Many, if not all, of these weaknesses can be worked out in time. The improvement of natural  protein levels is being given considerable emphasis in breeding programs.  * * *  In total, to date, the \"\"green revolution\"\" has probably not made any great contributions to improving the diet of many people because of population growth and the substitution for imports.

In some cases, the \"\"green revolution\"\" may have a substantial indirect influence on returns. This can come about, as suggested in a previous section, because the hyv's enhance the possibilities of multiple cropping, and may free land for the production of other crops. Both could substantially increase returns - for small as well as large farms.  b.

For all the talk about relative labor requirements of the hyv's, it is not easy to readily put one's hand on much data. The few studies we have noted are summarized in Table 1.  - Labor Per Unit of Land. Clearly the labor requirements have gone up for both hyv's of wheat and rice, though the increases may have been larger and more consistent than for rice.  - Labor Per Unit of Output. On this basis, labor requirements were either about the same or lower by up to 2QS^o.  The added labor required per unit of land may come from two sources: the family or the hired labor market.

To offset the risk involved at first, the reduction in cost (or gain in profit) must usually be significanto To get the \"\"green Revolution\"\" moving, a number of LDC governments have either adopted subsidies for inputs or price support purchase programs, or both. The hope is that once the \"\"green revolution\"\" has gained momentum, it will be possible to relax the support levels. This, of course, has not always been easy to do.  In order to provide a measure of the balance between costs and prices, a fertilizer/rice price ratio has been used in some Asian nations. (The ratio is particularly relevant because it is closely related to changes in yield;i/fertilizer may also serve as a proxy variable for other purchased inputs). The implicit fertilizer/rice ratio is felt to be an important factor in the adoption of the hyv package in some Asian nations such as Thailand.^/ And in some nations it is used explicitly as a tool for helping to establish government price policy.  The ratio leaves open the question of which factor should be adjusted or both. This is a very complex matter which is far from settled among economists. Input subsidies may be easier to reduce, and possibly they should be. The danger is that farmers may simply reduce their use at the same time. Price support levels may well have the greater psychological influence on the farmer. Each may in time be eroded away by inflation (unless the input subsidy is on a percentage basis).  Despite the problems, downward flexibility must be maintained if the hyv's are to ultimately make their full contribution to national economic growth.","page_count":0,"record_type":"secondary","parent_id":"p16022coll345:69542","first_viewer_type":"image","viewer_type":"image","child_index":197,"attachment":"69392.jp2","document_type":"item","featured_collection_order":999,"date_added":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","date_added_sort":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","date_modified":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"p16022coll345:69390","object":"https://cdm16022.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/getthumbnail/collection/p16022coll345/id/69390","set_spec":"p16022coll345","collection_name":"Norman E.

This is not often sorted out.  Tn any case, more enlightened policies toward mechanization are needed. Reduction of factor price distortions would be a big step.  This might be followed by or combined with a more selective policy of mechanization - Oiie which examines the alternative types of tracteri-zation and the possible effects on employment.  3. Distribution of Benefits  While the \"\"green revolution\"\" to date has produced an impressive array of benefits - some conjectural, some factual - it has hardly been uniformly acclaimed. The main reason is that, like any technology, its fruits are unevenly distributed.  The key problem to date at the production level has been that in many cases the added return has been largely retained by the farm owner or operator, while relatively little has flowed down to the landless laborer. While the level of earnings of the landless laborer has seldom been reduced (except where mechanization has been involved) and more often probably has been raised somewhat, this is not enough. The laborer sees his employment being threatened by mechanization,  and/or the farm operator getting much larger returns.  This is not entirely fancy.

The Life Cycle in Mexican Wheat  There is really only one country to which we can look for information on the whole life cycle of a \"\"green revolution\"\" innovation.

China  both Chinas in fact  are really sub-tropical or sub-temperate, so that their rice changes are not what we are talking about. The Green Revolution in the Asian countries where it is so much touted  is really just getting well underway.

We cannot read the future, so we don't know whether Mexico's wheat transformation is reaching senility or not. We hope not. It is, certainly in full maturity at least.  We pointed out above the \"\"milestones\"\" in the life cycle of Mexico's wheat transformation, events which may be compared to life-crisis rites like First Communion or marriage: half of wheat land converted at the age of 5; doubled yields country-wide and replacement of imports by age 10; 90% of wheat lands converted by age 12; and non-economic exports developed by 15.

Indeed, this year, Mexico could export wheat profitably farmers would produce a surplus at the farm price they have been receiving.  If real farm prices have been cut in half in two decades, haven't farmers borne the brunt of consiamer benefits? Well, not exactly. Their real production costs have been roughly halved too thanks to the new  seeds, but also thanks to more ingenious machinery and more fertilizer  piguce- \"\"0 . ...  and more efficient farming.^ After a honeymoon period of high profitability  for the early adopters of the new seeds and techniques in the \"\"green  revolution's\"\" adolescence, farmers' profits from wheat growing have  settled back to about where they were before it all began. Highly  efficient farmers with good land and water availability make good  profits in wheat; others without those assets just scrape by. Wheat  farmers own more machinery now than they did in 1948, but their profits  have returned to \"\"normal\"\". It is the dilemma of farmers that they  are usually perfect competitors in a world dominated by oligopolies  and oligopsonies.

A good guess would be 20%.  These results are remarkably suggestive of evidence from other countries where the \"\"green revolution\"\" is now adolescent. Relatively good farm-management data permit comparison between new and old seeds for Muzzafarnagar and Ferozepore Districts in India (wheat), for state farms in Tunisia (wheat), for a nation-wide farm sample in the Philippines (rice) and for Kisii District in Kenya (hybrid maize). Observers familiar with research-station reports about doubling or tripling of yields or more have been disappointed with these results. The Mexican ejqjerience, in which yields have been tripled and more, suggest that they should bear the life cycle of the new techniques in mind, keep up hope, and keep working on breeding and extension.

Is the conposite of these families  the constellation oi-wheat-culture changes in Mexico in other words  now nearing the' upper end of the S-curve? We have no way of knowing. True, the bluebird varieties, probably the seventh \"\"family\"\" released since 1948, yield only about 10% higher than their predecessors.

After all, visitors to the Museo Anthropologico will see little resemblance between that ear of maize found while excavating the Torre Latinoamericana and the maize we know. The point here is not to read the future however. It is the naivete of the publicists who talk about a miracle variety, who think that you can import a^ new variety like IR-8 rice into a country and solve its problems. In Mexico, Lerma Rojo wheat probably represented the single biggest improvement of any variety over its predecessors, yet it was no miracle.  The danger of thinking in terms of miracle varieties and simple solutions is reinforced by looking at disease problems. Farmers liked and adopted Mexico's new wheat varieties in substantial measure due to their resistance to rusts, their major disease problem. Yet the new varieties did not, by any means, conquer rust. Northwest Mexico had a major rust epidemic as late as 1959, when \"\"new\"\" varieties were virtually the only ones grown there and fully 11 years after their introduction.

The naivete, indeed, folly of thinking in terms of single miracle varieties is obvious.  C. The Adoption  Equity  Mexican evidence sheds interesting light on the common contention that the \"\"green revolution\"\" favors the larger farmers at the ej^ense of the smaller and makes the rich richer and the poor poorer. Evidence to support such contentions, invariably comes from situations in which the \"\"green revolution\"\" is in the adolescent part of its life cycle, or even earlier.  Keith Griffin has tried to give this phenomenon some systematic explanation by postulating discrimination against the small, the poor and the tenants in factor prices. He indicates that some innovations  may be profitable enough to overcome these market imperfections which discriminate against the poor and be profitably adopted by everybody.  Mexican wheat evidently presents such a case. Every wheat farmer grows \"\"new\"\" varieties, and though wheat farmers are quite large on average and though wheat is a crop ideally suited for farms with level land, much capital and little family labor, there are small wheat farmers in Mexico. According to the 1960 Agricultural Census, 43% of the wheat land was on ejidal farms.  This total conversion does not mean that big farmers and small farmers are benefitting equally. If there is discrimination in factor markets based on farm size, tenure, etc., it affects profits.

This pattern is being repeated in other \"\"green revolution\"\" countries, though climatic obstacles may well stop their diffusion short of the totality achieved in Mexico.  The machine-using nature of the wheat production techniques that have evolved also involes equity questions. Labor use has declined from 30-40 man-days per ton using exclusively animal traction in the old days to less than one man-day per ton in the northwest today, using lots of big machinery, of coxirse. 10/ Needless to say, this process has not helped to relieve the hard, sometimes sordid lot of Mexico's rural poor, both the landless rural laborers, now estimated to number 2.5 to 3 million, and the millions of very small private farmers and ejidatarios with plots too small to employ all of their family labor. 11/  Mexican wheat culture was getting more mechanized before the new varieties were introduced and has continued to do so over the life cycle of the new techniques.

A close look at Government cost-of-production figures shows that using 40 man-days and 20 burro-days to fultivatjfe one hectare of wheat permitted farmers to get by when labor counted at 3 pesos per day in the Bajio in 1950, but not in Mexicali where it cost 10 pesos per day.  The Government could have, perhaps should have, taxed machines to shift the indifference point between using machines and using human labor. It did not do so until recently, however, and then machine imports were restrained not to force more labor-intensive farming but to build up the Mexican farm-machinery industry. History aside, however, the technical evidence suggests that massive taxes on machinery would have been necessary to keep wheat from getting mechanized in Mexico. The indifference point between machines and men is closer for most other crops.  All of this evidence seems to suggest that mechanization of Mexican wheat came about due to the economic context and not as a result of the intrinsic qualities of the new varieties. On the other side, one can argue that the new varieties made wheat farming highly profitable and that those profits made mechanization possible. Also, the new seeds are very fussy about being planted at just the right depth  something it is easier to do with a seed drill and by broadcasting and dragging a log over the field with a burro.

THE GREEN REVOLUTION IN ASIA  Having examined the course of the \"\"green revolution\"\" in a country where it has attained a mature state in the technological life cycle, we now turn to Asia where the \"\"green revolution,\"\" as we have defined it, is a far more recent thing.^ It dates, in fact, from the mid-1960's and in no place had the adoption rate by the I970/7I season significantly exceed 50^ of the crop area.  Against the Mexican backdrop, many of the characteristics of the adoption process, the effect on quantity of output, and the economic and social implications to date will seem familiar. But several characteristics of the \"\"green revolution\"\" in Asia have their own distinctive character  most notably the inclusion of rice and the effect of the high-yielding varieties (hyv's) on multiple cropping. In addition, we will look at the effect of the \"\"green revolution\"\" on nutritional quality. The focus will be almost entirely on wheat and rice.  A. Adoption Process  The data presented on the annual increase in area planted to the hyv's in the first section of this paper suggest a very rapid overall rate of adoption in certain Asian nations. In some of the most advanced areas, such as Pakistan's Punjab, farmers were more rapid in adoption of the new wheat seed and less conservative in using it than were Iowa _  I 2 ^  farmers in the adoption of hybrid corn in the 1930*s and 19^0's.-^","page_count":0,"record_type":"secondary","parent_id":"p16022coll345:69542","first_viewer_type":"image","viewer_type":"image","child_index":173,"attachment":"69368.jp2","document_type":"item","featured_collection_order":999,"date_added":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","date_added_sort":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","date_modified":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"p16022coll345:69368","object":"https://cdm16022.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/getthumbnail/collection/p16022coll345/id/69368","set_spec":"p16022coll345","collection_name":"Norman E.

Since the hjrv package is new to many farmers,  there is uncertainty about how well it will fare in a given area. The traditional varieties have generally been selected, if nothing else, for their suitability to local growing conditions. Will the new variety be as resistant to variations in water supply, insects and diseases, etc?

And examining the \"\"green revolution\"\" cycle for Mexican wheat provides a foretaste of what may in part occur in other nations,  1. Complete vs. Partial Diffusion  The \"\"green revolution\"\" is at quite different stages of adoption in Mexico and in a number of other countries. Diffusion is complete for Mexican wheat, but not elsewhere. Yet, some of the other nations have showed an astonishingly similar rate of adoption for wheat in their early years. This is shown in Figtire 11 ,  Not every country, however, will show the same pattern for wheat or rice (we don't have a \"\"Mexico\"\" for rice to provide a parallel situation).

Great advances were still to be made in breeding, in adoption of better practices and greater cash - input use by farmers, and in further adaptation and diffusion of the package.  2, The Life Cycle and Self Sufficiency  Typically, a \"\"green revolution\"\" country starts as a high-cost grain producer and an importer. Thanks to technical change, it lowers its production costs and increases local production at the expense of imports, thus employing local factors instead of spending foreign exchange.

Brown has outlined three steps which are often involved in the process:  - First, the production drive usually overshoots the target and results in large surpluses.  - Secondly, the country trys to export these surpluses and usually finds that it is not competitive in price or quality, or both.  - Thirdly, there is a frantic effort to diversity out of the surplus crop into other crops. They find that to do this properly takes time, advance planning, new techniques, and many adjustments.

Effect on Eicployment  How you interpret the \"\"green revolution's\"\" effect on labor use depends largely on whether the country is importing grains or has reached self-sufficiency. If India or Mexico is replacing wheat imports from the United States, every man-day of labor spent producing a ton of wheat instead of importing it is a local gain in employment, at least in the context of underemployment.

These contributions are, of course, more marked where the \"\"green revolution\"\"  is at an advanced stage in its life cycle. There axe relatively few countries at this point yet.  One economic contribution - the effect on increasing food output - is well recognized. Productivity is increased. The need for imports is lessened. In turn, as we have noted, the benefits of the e3q)anded output are, as self-sufficiency is reached, transferred to consumers in the form of lower prices.

As prices fall, producers may be driven to the wall in disadvantaged regions, with serious human and regional consequences. We suspect that, in the long run, such consequences will prove more serious than inequities occurring between early and late adopters.  In retrospect, Mexico's laggard wheat farmers came through the great wheat transformation rather well. Their more progressive neighbors made high profits by adopting the innovations while they were highly profitable, but thanks to Mexico's land reform, they were unable to use those profits to buy the land rights of the less progressive.  These profits to leaders may be a temporary phenomenon which more diffusion will eliminate, but a society's institutions certainly govern what the progressive can do to the others during that period. Evidence is scattered, but it suggests that institutions in some countries, like Pakistan and Ethiopia, do far less to protect the unprogressive froin|jbhe rapacious (and quite natural) greed of early adopters than Mexico's institutions did.  As prices fall, will grain farmers become disillusioned and refuse further innovation? Mexico's experience suggests that the answer is \"\"No.\"\" Farmers are sensitive to price changes, to be sure. Mexican wheat production fell in 1970 and 1971 when the government set the price too low. Within limits, though, falling prices are a whip for ever faster technical change.

The increased local competition meai s lower prices, (just how much lower depends on the elasticities of supply and demand involved.) Governments that attempt to maintain support prices after self-sufficiency, in the face of continued technical improvement, will lose large amounts of money either storing the surplus or exporting it at a loss.  Mexico's past experience, which may be prologue for others, shows that the government will have to cut farm support prices as technical progress proceeds after self-sufficiency. This happens despite vehement farmer protests, which India started to appreciate when cuts were anticipated in the wheat support price in 1971. But it means gains for consumers, unless a state marketing monopoly or some other kind of monopoly can capture all of the gains. Lower staple food prices can mean improved living for urban workers, or lower labor costs and bigger profits for entrepreneurs (private or public, foreign or local), or some of each.  3.

Generally all eventually have to face lower prices.  For farmers, weeikening prices mean the end of high profits.

Only Mexico has unambiguously reached this situation, and, since wheat is only the secondary staple in Mexico, the employment effects of the labor use changes are nearly lost in the greater economy. But other countries may well follow Mexico in reaching self-sufficiency. What would this mean for Indonesia if less than one man-day were needed to produce a ton of rice some years from now?  b. Effect on Prices  A similar before-or-after-self-sufficiency dualism applies to the distribution of \"\"green revolution\"\" benefits between producers and consumers.  During the drive for self-sufficiency, governments generally maintain prices and keep demand strong. If prices are not allowed to drop, consumers do not benefit. But for the eaorly adopters of the cost-cutting innovations, profit margins may be high - though of course,  they may have to share them with creditors, fertilizer monopolies, landlords or tax collectors.  Once self-sufficiency is reached, but economic exports cannot be sustained, the tune changes.

In the long run, therefore, the fruits of technical change fall to the consumer, not the farmer.  A second order effect is that as incomes are raised in this way, consumers may either step up their purchases of that product or of others. Generally as incomes rise, consumers buy more products such as fruits, vegetables, meats and dairy products. These products both improve nutritional quality and, often being labor-intensive in nature, are a source of further employment. Moreover, the increased production of \"\"green revolution\"\" grains or these other products requires greater inputs on the part of supply firms or makes greater use of marketing firms - in turn increasing both employment and income effects elsewhere Thus the new technology, like a pebble tossed in a pond, can set into motion waves of effects.  By making such basic contributions, new technologies lay the base for a far wider range of economic development. And without a broader technological base, as Falcon has put it, increases in overall production,  3/  income, and employment will surely be more difficult. At the same time many of the things the \"\"green revolution\"\" has been criticized for are reflections of more general agricultural or social problems. Thus, the employment problem is economy-wide in character; its solution requires economic development. Thus advances in technology may be a necessary but not sufficient step in the improvement of society's lot.

To cast aside agricultural technologies because they are not fully equitable is both shortsighted and socially counter-productive.

After all, human history does not record major progress in agriculture or in other fields unaccompanied by serious strains or stresses in society... These strains and dislocations are part of the adjustment process that progress inevitably creates. It is within the ability of human beings and their organizations to solve these problems and bring around the structural changes that, in any case, societies will have to go through.^  What are some of the particular problems which the \"\"green revolution\"\" may engender within rural social structure and how might we go about approaching them?

It has avoided the massive famine that appeared imminent in Asia in the late sixties. It has not eliminated hunger. It did enable India to achieve economic self-sufficiency in cereals in 1972, i. e., India's farmers were producing as mach as consumers could buy at prevailing prices. This is not to be confused with nutritional self-sufficiency, which requires much greater purchasing power than now exists for a large segment of the population. Despite the drought, India probably would not be importing food grains now if it had not been for the some two million tons provided earlier to refugees from Bangladesh.  Within India progress is uneven between wheat and rice. Progress in expanding wheat can only be described as spectacular, increasing from 11 million tons in the mid-sixties to an estimated 27 million tons in 1973, If this rate of gain continues for three more years, India will have tripled its wheat output in weather adjusted terms within a decade. Insofar as I am aware, this rate of growth in production is unmatched by any other major crop in a major country.  Growth in Indian rice production has been more modest to date than in some other countries. But it too now appears to be slowly gaining momentum. Overall cereal output per person has increased slightly in recent years, despite the population increase, reversing the downtrend of the early sixties.  This is not to argue for complacency. Hunger and malnutrition are still widespread in India, particularly in the drought stricken areas. But to properly assess the Green Revolution, one need only ask would the food situation be like in India, or in the developing countries generally, had there not been a Green Revolution. Sketching out this grim alternative scenario helps one to understand the real contribution of the Green Revolution to the alleviation of hunger and malnutrition in the developing countries.  MEXICO'S  AGRICULTURAL  EXPORTS  The American Chamber of Commerce of Mexico recently issued a \"\"datografia\"\"' on Mexico's agricultural exports, which are very impressive.

In his latest effoi-t to demonstrate that the Green Revolution is a myth, a \"\"phrase invented by American AID bureacrats\"\", Bernard Nossiter makes several errors. One is to imply that those involved in launching the Green Revolution considered it a pancea for the world's food problem. Another is to blame rising rural unemployment on the Green Revolution, though this trend exists quite independently from the introduction of new high-yielding wheats and rice.  Now that five years or so have passed since its beginning, it might be useful to try and put the Green Revolution in perspective by indicating what it is and is not, and what it has not achieved.  The Grenn Revolution is a shorthand expression used to describe the introduction and rapid spread of high-yielding varieties of wheat and rice in several major developing countries. For the high-yielding dwarf wheats bred m Mexico to be successful they must have adequate supplies of water, as in irrigated Pakistan, or the high-rainfall coastal areas of Turkey The high-yielding dwarf rices, developed in the Philippines, will thrive only where the water supply is adequate and carefully controlled.

This work lasted until 1945 and resulted in several durum and common wheat cultivars, which, together with the improvement of agronomic methods, increased the average national yield from 700 kg/ha to 1,200 kg/ha, with top yields of 3,500 kg/ha.  During the period beginning after 1945 more and more attention was devoted to breeding for resistance to various factors such as diseases (stem, stripe and leaf rusts) and lodgingo Breeding programmes were based mainly on crosses between adapted \"\"agronomic\"\" varieties and resistance sources. Concurrently, the introduction of new breeding material from abroad was continued.  New aestivum cultivars, Florence-Aurore, Merav and others, almost entirely replaced the durums and contributed to a further increase in yields, which reached 1,500-2,000 kg/ha in the early sixties. Top yields of 5,000-5,500 kg/ha were recorded in this period.  The introduction of the first semi-dwarfs from CIMMYT in 1960 was the starting point of a new period of wheat breeding in our country and resulted in an increase in the yielding ability by about 40% compared with F1orence-Aurore, the standard wheat variety in Israel since 1955.

These cultivars are also susceptible to the local races of stripe and stem rusts, as well as to Septoria leaf blotdh, resulting in inconsistent yields. Consequently, in spite of their much higher yielding ability, semi-dwarfs did not always outyield Florence-Aurore or other \"\"classical\"\" varieties.  A programme aiming at breeding new double-gene (DG)* and triple-gene (TG)** semi-dwarf cultivars, combining a high yielding ability with a good baking quality and resistance to the most prevalent diseases, was started in 1963 at the Volcani Center, Bet Dagan. A large number of crosses, involving various CIMMYT semi-dwarfs and several tall (110-120 cm. high) cultivars, were made in 1963 and the following yearSo In order to urge breeding results, two generations of segregating material were raised per year, one in the normal autumn-spring wheat growing season at Bet Dagan (coastal plain), the other in the summer at a high elevation farm near Jerusalem, The segregating material was screened in the breeding nurseries for height, reaction to diseases, phenology and other agronomic traits; lines designated for further breeding were harvested and screened in the laboratory for their technological properties.

The mean wheat yields increased up to 3,000kg/ha and even more and top yields of 8,000-9,000 kg/ha were recorded. The national wheat production increased up to 65% of the domestic consumption, as compared to about 20% produced ten years ago.

One is to imply that those involved in launching the Green Revolution considered it a panacea for the world's food problem. Another is to blame rising rural unemployment on the Green Revolution, though this trend e.\\ists quite independently from the introduction of new hiGh-yielding wheats and rices.  Xow that five yeai's or so have passed since its beginning, it might be useful to iiy and put the Green Revolution in perspective by indicating what it is and is not, and what it has and has not achieved.  The Green Revolution is a shorthand expression used to describe the introduction and rapid spread of high-yielding varieties of wheat and rice in several major devflopinc countries. For the high-yieldinj: dwarf wheats bred in Mexico to ho successful they must have adequate supplies of wat^^r, as in irrigated Pakistan. r>r tho his'n-rainfall costal areas of Turkey. The high-yieldins dwarf rices, devclop'^d in the Philippines, will thrive only where the water supply is adequate and care-  fully controlled. The Green Revolution is not a magic technique for rapidly expanding; production of all cereals under all conditions found in the developing countries.  What has it achieved? It has avoided the massive famine that appeared imminent in Asia in the late sixties. It has not eliminated hunger. It did enable India to achieve economic self-sufficiency in cereals in 1972, i.e., India's farmers were producing as much as consumers could buy at prevailing prices. This is not to be confused with nutritional self-sufficiency, which requires much greater purchasing power than now exists for a large segment of the population. Despite the drought. India probably would not be importing food grains now if it had not been for the some two million tons proxided earlier to refugees from Bangladesh.  Within freiia progress is uneven be-twt?cn wheat and rice. Progress ih expanding wheat can only be f;<-scribod as spectacular, increasing from 11 mil-lu)n tons in the mid-sixties to an t-sti-mated 27 million tons in l.Q7^. Jf this rate of gain continues for three more years, India will have tripled its wheat  output in weather adiasted terms within a decade. Insofar as I am aware, this rate of growth in production is unmatched by any other major crop :n a major counti-y.  Growth in Indian rice produclion has been more modest lo date than in some other countries. But it too now appears to be slowly aainini: momentum. Overall cereal output per person has increased slightly in recent years, despite the population increase, reversing the downtrend of the early sixties.  This is not to argue for com.'/ia-cency. Hunger and malnutrition are still widespread in India, particularly in the drought stricken arras. But 10 properly assess the Green Revolution, one need only ask what would : tie lood situation be like in India, or in the developing countries generally, had there not been a Green Revolution. Sketching out this grim alternative scenario helps one to understand real contribution of the Green Revolution to the alleviation of himcer and malnutrition in the developing countries.  LESTER R.

Increases in world population continue to outrace increases in world food supply giving Agriculturists one of the biggest challenges ever given to man. Can we feed the world or will famine prove the Malthusian theory correct? We in North America with our vast potential for supplying food have a responsibility to the rest of the world. We as Agriculture students, the future planners of world food supply have a responsibility to cbmmunlcatft and seriously consider the challenge of feeding four billion people, I,A,S.A.A. is an Organization which brings together people who will be setting Agricultural policy in the future for the world and in particular North America, I feel we should take advantage of the opportunities the Organization offers.

Maybe you could, but your answer may differ from another's, I.A.S.A.A. is just what you make it.  It can be good - it can be bad, because people are different and expect something different in a conference. It is hard to satisfy all, but those who are dissatisfied should speak up. But if you criticize, you should also suggest an alternative.

Jaswant was an early convert to the hybrid seeds, having seen what they produced on a visit to the 1967 \"\"Kishan Mela\"\" (farmers'fair) at the Punjab Agri cultural University in Ludhiana, a booming market city 30 miles from his home. (The university was started in 1961 with rupees owned by the U.S. government as a result of the sale of wheat and other foodstuffs to India under the now dormant Public Law 480 program, and intially staffed by experts from Ohio State University.) The seeds he now uses are Indian-developed variants on Dr. Borlaug's Mexican strain, which produce meal more suited to Indian tastes and plants more resistant to local pests and diseases.  It is true that like a successful farmer anywhere in the world Jaswant has to spend money--about half his gross-- on seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, equipment and labor. For plowing and harrowing, he hires a tractor from a state agro-industries center. When the crop is ready for harvesting, it is mechanically reaped and threshed by machines that travel around the state at harvest time. The important point is he does not have to own the mechanical equipment as Nossiter's report seemed to imply.  The hiring and pooling of farm equipment is new in India and may seem to some a small advance until you remember that it is only a long generation ago that many sma.ll American farmers depended on similar resources.  *Vater for irrigation is an additional requirement. Although the state gets about 20 inches of rainfall annually, more than North Dakota, our second largest wheat producer, most of the rain comes in the three brief months of the monsoon, well before planting time. Jaswant depends on a tubewell, a pipe driven 100 feet into the ground and run by an electric pump, for irrigation. It cost him $150, a sizeable outlay, but there are cheap government loans available for such purposes and Jaswant, like an American farmer, went to the bank for help.  Nationally there are 2.5 million tubewells in use, compared to 200,000 in 1960. In the Punjab, Jaswant's rig is one of 185,000, seven times more than there were in 1966.  Unfortunately, the boom has not been universal. There has been no solid breakthrough in the production of other crops. Of these, rice is the principal one--the staple food of 75 per cent of the population.  India plant scientists are doggedly trying to evolve new strains from the  miracle rice and there have been some encouraging experimental results.  It is still too soon to decide that a solution cannot be found and to affix a large label \"\"Failure\"\" to the program.

Outside of Mexico, high-yielding varieties (hyv's) of wheat and rice began their take-off in the mid-1960's. The timing was fortunate because this was a period of severe drought in South Asia and world food supplies had sunk to low levels. The rate of adoption through I970/7I, as indicated in Table 1, has been rapid. As of 1970/71, excluding Latin America, the hyv vrtieat and rice areas outside of communist nations were each about 25 million acres (10.2 million ha.). In terms of the total area planted to wheat and rice in the less developed nations (LDC's)jhowever, the hyv area was still relatively small.

Although the \"\"green revolution\"\" is only part way through the adoption cycle in many areas of the world, there is one exception: Mexico. Mexico has essentially completed the adoption cycle for wheat.  The rapid rate of adoption of the new wheat varieties has already been noted (Figure 2). As a result, by the 10th year of adoption (1958) national yields had doubled, and they have now risen to roughly four times what they were when the \"\"green revolution began\"\" (Figure 3).  These yield increases made it possible to raise mere wheat on less land (Figure 2) and to lower costs. Between 1950 and 1970, farmers' unit costs in real terms were roughly halved.

The verdict of most who write on the subject is that in many countries this has turned out to be the case. Generally the poor do benefit, but the rich oenefit more, and income disparities grow worse. Such an outcome is almost inevitable. In most countries the small farnier will find it hard to raise the credit necessary to buy the HYV seeds and chemicals. If he has only one crop between his family and starvation, it makes sense to let others take the first risk on new methods. Hence it is usually the larger farmers who adopt the new techniques first and make the biggest profits.  If prices and credit structure are right, small farmers will generally follow their lead quite quickly, but profits tend to be less for those who adopt later, in part because of increased supply, in part because the government may by then have reduced the usual subsidy. For Mexican wheat farmers, among whom the Green Revolution has gone through its full cycle, both prices and costs have dropped steadily since the new seeds were first introduced. The net result is that \"\"farmers' profits from wheat growing have settled back to about where they were before it all began,\"\" according to a study by William I. Jones of the World Bank. Iri Mexico the ultimate beneficiary is the urban consumer, who pays less for wheat. (The Mexican poor eat corn, but they stand to benefit indirectly in that the government need not spend foreign exchange on wheat imports.)  The income disparities caused by the Green Revolution thus depend partly on the stage of the adoption cycle a country has reached, being greatest at its outset. They also depend critically on land distribution, being grosser the less justly land is held. Both in Mexico and the Indian Punjab, the two leading showcases for the Green Revolution, land distribution is comparatively equitable.  A second major criticism made by economists and sociologists is that the Green Revolution displaces labor and increases rural unemployment. Like almost every other effect the revolution is praised or blamed for, rural unemployment existed and was on the rise before the new techniques were introduced. The Green Revolution should in theory be labor-intensive. The HYV's require more care and attention in ground preparation, plant-  20 DECEMBER 1974  Table 1.

Where they make it possible to get a second crop into the growing season, they double the need for labor. But in part because of its labor-intensity, the Green Revolution also ofl^ers the incentiveand profitsfor the larger farmers to mechanize.  The mechanization that in practice accompanies the Green Revolution is itselt double-edged; the use of tractors for rapid land preparation, for example, may create extra jobs bv giving time for a second crop. But overall, mechanization is job destroying. According to one estimate, nearly 20 percent of labor in the Punjab will be displaced by machines by 1984.  For the moment the job creating aspect of the Green Revolution generally predominates over the job destroying influence of mechanization. Falcon, for example, estimates that with the new technology perhaps 30 percent more labor is used per acre. (Less labor is needed, however, per ton of food produced, which may entail fewer jobs once the country attains self-sufi'iciency.) In the longer run, unless fuel prices remain prohibitive, and if governments persist with tariff policies that favor imports of tractors, the positive impact of the Green Revolution on employment is likely to be swamped by mechanization. Yet the less developed countries, with no large industrial base to mop up labor, cannot easily afford to undergo the same kind of agricultural revolution that in the United States has forced some 30 million people to leave their rural homes for the city.  Unemployment, income disparities between classes and regions, and other untoward consequences of the Green Revolution are often said to be threatening the social and political fabric of  society. \"\"Far from reducing social tensions in rural areas,\"\" warns a World Bank working paper on agriculture,  the spread of the new technology is likely to sharpen them, and to lead to greater demand for the implementation of measures, such as land reform, for the redistribution of income and wealth.\"\" According to political scientist Francine Frankel* of the University of Pennsylvania, the evenhanded-ness of the scientific methodthe fact that the Green Revolution evidently works as well on the aristocrat's estate as on the sharecropper's plotengenders the dangerous notion that all classes should benefit from it equally:  I he Green Revolution, therefore, is ihc instrument of ever more complete erosion in truditional social and political forr^is. In those areas where the new technology has been most extensively applied, it has accomplished what centuries of disruption under colonial rule failed to achieve: the virtual elimination of the stabilizing re-sidium of traditional society, the recognition of mutual, non-symmetric obligations by both the landed and landless classes.  Such predictions of social disruption have not yet been widely realized, though that may be only because the Green Revolution has been slower than e.xpected in expanding out of its base areas. Whether the social changes in question should be chalked up to the Green Revolution's credit or debit is something else again.  Is the Green Revolution an equitable technology, in the sense of being equally accessible to small farmers and large? Inequity is \"\"absolutely implicit\"\" in Green Revolution technology, according to Donald K. Freebairn of Cornell, because the inputs and skills it requires are not evenly distributed among members of the society. On the other hand, Dairymple and Jones consider the Green Revolution to be \"\"as close as we will ever get to a massively adopted, inherently equitable technology. ' Provided that a government ensures equity in the provision of credit and supporting services, the technology itself will perform as well in a small field as in a large, and is generally neutral to scale. An important exception, according to Frankel, is that, in India at least, farmers whose plots are smaller than 10 acres or so may find it uneconomical to invest in a tube well, and too risky to grow HYV's without one.

The Green Revolution is neither miracle nor hoax, nor has it shot its bolt. Before considering its social and economic impact, it is important to note that the acreage planted to Green Revolution cropsor high yielding varieties (HYV's)is still increasing in almost linear fashion, although the average yields of HYV crops have ceased to be quite as spectacular as in the early years. By crop year 1972/ 73, some 41.6 million acres in Asia and North Africa were being planted to HYVs of wheat and 38.7 million acrcs to those of rice, amountina roughly to 35 and 20 percent respectively of the total wheat and rice areas in these countries.  Not included in these figures is Mexico, where the Green Revolution techniques were first developed by the Rockefeller Foundation's research in-stiuue, now known as CIMMYT. More than 90 percent of Mexico's wheat land is sown to the HYV.'s developed by Norman Borlaug. although ^ CIMMYT's corn program, whose I HYV s occupy less than 10 percent of ihe corn land, has been something of a troM by comparison.  i The steady growth in acreage of HYVs masks several liinitations in real progress.

The HYVs by and large grow best on irrigated land. For this reason they remain heavily concentrated in just a few areas; 81 percent of the HYV wheat is grown in a small area of India and Pakistan, and four coimtries (India, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Bangladesh) account for 83 percent of the HYV rice.  Though HYV acreage has expanded each year, there has been a slow but steady decline in yield. According to Indian government statistics, yields of HYV wheats have dropped from nearly 4 to 2!i times those of traditional varieties over the last 6 years and rice yields have also fallen off (see Table 1). Bad weather probably contributed to yield declines in the I970\"\"s, but the principal cause underlying the downward trend is simply that the best land tends to be planted first to HYV's. A rule-of-thunib estimate by Dana G. Dalrymple of the U.S. Department of Agriculture is that if HYV's and iraditional strains were grown on the  V.'     - t - *.  j'. v'^.V,\"\"    Media,liccil reapcr.c rvphicc the sickle in Northern India.

These are quite modest margins of superiority compared with the multiple yields often talked abouta sharp illustration of the gap between the farmer's field and the researchers experimental plot. One of the chief troubles of the Green Revolution is that, though equitable in theory, it doesn't in practice work as well for everj'one.  The most distinctive of the Green Revolution package of practices is the seed. Traditional varieties of wheat and rice cannot make proper use of fertilizer since it causes them to grow too tall and topple over. The HYV's incorporate a dwarfing gene which gives the plant a short, stiff straw and enables it to respond to fertilizer with larger yields. Other genetic improvements include resibtance to certain pests but chemical pesticides need to be applied as wellas well as insensitivity to day length, and shorter maturation, characteristics which together mean that a second crop can sometimes be squeezed in before the end of the growing season. Besides fertilizer and pesticides, most HYVs developed so far also respond best to controlled supplies of water, which requires the land to be irrigated, not just rain fed.  These techniques may sound simple, but their impact is felt forcefully, if variously, throughout the fabric of the rural society. \"\"For the poor, the Green Revolution in Java offers only the choice between servitude and home-lessness,\"\" says Richard W. Franke of Monlclair State College, New Jersey. Vet in the Indian Punjab, according to S. S.

But man cannot exist on bread.alone. Existence can be very dreary if that is his only preoccupation.

This \"\"revolution^' has generated a great deal of interest, and in some instances, criticism. From the scientific view, the Green Revolution was the development of short, stiff-strawed varieties of wheat and rice which are more responsive to fertilizers, and, because of their day-length independence, are widely adapted. It is now possible to grow crops such as wheat in countries near the equator where formerly they were restricted to the higher latitudes with their 14-hour days. These new varieties, coupled with a package of technological practices, have greatly heightened the potential for increased food production, particularly in those countries where crop yields are stagnant while populations are increasing at a frightening rate.  Much has been written by both the informed and the uninformed ahniit the impact made by the Green Revolution. Perhaps the most significant point that is frequently overlooked, particularly by the non-agriculturist, is that agriculture has experienced a whole series of \"\"green revolutions\"\" starting some 9,000 years ago when man gave up his nomadic existence. The fact that contributions from the sciences and the ingenuity of the farmer have made agiiculture the most efficient and productive activity that man has  ever undertaken is frequently forgotten or not understood by those who get no closer to food production than the nearest supermarket. Technological breakthroughs such as the development of hybrid corn, application of chemistry to farming, improvements in tillage and cultural practices, and mechanization are just a few of the many contributions. In fact, if it had not been for these achievements, the predictions made by Malthus in 1798 that the population would surpass food production would have long since been realized.  Why the concern?  Why then has the development of high yielding wheat and rice varieties, which appear to offer so much promise to those countries where famine is now a fact of life, been a cause for so much concern? There are a number of reasons. The most pressing is the realization by people throughout the world that Malthus was not wrong in his prediction but just a bit premature. If the population monster is considered in terms of the number of years it has taken to double itself, the problem becomes apparent. From 1600 to 1840, a period of 240 years, the population increased from 0.5-billion to 1 billion. It now appears that if present trends continue, the population will double from 4 to 8 billion between now and the year 2000.  This is coupled with an awareness by those in the so-called developed countries that the resulting problems will not be restricted to the less privileged. The  basic fact then emerges that this earth simply does not have the resources necessary to support the existing population increase and to maintain an acceptable quality of life. Those scientists most directly responsible for the Green Revolution never claimed that this breakthrough would do more than buy some additional time to give man the opportunity to find solutions to other problems such as population control.  How little time remains was clearly demonstrated in 1972 when both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres experienced simultaneous drouths which exhausted the world grain reserves in just 1 year. It now is becoming apparent that this was not a 1-year crisis, but that chronic shortages of food supplies on a major scale are here to stay.  Critics of the Green Revolution generally voice their concerns on social and economic considerations. They frequently suggest that the poor become poorer while the most prosperous farmer receives all the benefits. .Certainly, a farmer with large land holdings can more easily afford to take the risk and break with traditional agriculture. To try to introduce new technology to the subsistence farmer and expect the new methods to migrate upward would be naive.  In many areas where governments have provided credit and necessary supportive services, the smaller farmers have quickly accepted the new ways. Theodore W.

Farmers, rich and poor in the developing countries, are no different from farmers throughout the world: if proper incentives are present they will readily accept new methods.. The dramatic in-crease in the land devoted to growing the new varieties would certainly support this conclusion because much of the land in many developing countries consists of small land holdings.  Wide-spread unemployment is also attributed to the Green Revolution. It is frequently charged that technology needed to produce dramatic yield increases is of Western origin and frequently requires mechanization resulting in fewer people being needed to carry out the farming operation. However, this is not the case in most countries. With greater production, the potential for double cropping and the related services have, in fact, increased employment. In future years, this need for mechanization may cause unemployment and greater disparities in income between classes and regions; however, one must examine this consequence in light of not accepting this technology.  These problems as well as 1 others in the social and economic areas attributed to the Green Revolution are not new. In fact, they have been limiting progress in the developing countries for centuries. What the Green Revolution has done is to bring them to the surface so, hopefully, those in the other disciplines such as social science can gain a better understanding of the real problems plaguing the developing world and ^come forth with solutions.  Concerns have also been expressed with regard to scientific considerations involving the Green Revolution. Some have said the  '6 CROPS & SOILS MAGAZINE/MARCH  new varieties are energy dependent, requiring fertilizers and pesticides to achieve maximum yield. Certainly, as with all biological organisms with suitable nutrition and protection, a more favorable growth response will be achieved. The so-called environmentalists who cry out against the use of 1 pesticides without regard to the actual facts certainly are not found among the less privileged on this earth. R. C. Beatty's book^ The DDT Myth: Triumph of the Amateurs, should be required reading for these people.  Similarly, those who propose that organic farming is the only way have never paused long enough to reahze how limited food production would be under such conditions. The current inflated fertilizer prices will reduce crop yields in countries which cannot afford to compete for the necessary products on the world market. However, if priorities in some of the developing countries were changed so that some of the $26 billion which is currently spent on armaments each year were spent for fertilizer plants, this problem would not be as acute.  How delicate?  It has also been charged that the new varieties only do well under favorable conditions where high rainfall or irrigation exists. Certainly these varieties do have the genetic potential to yield more under favorable conditions when compared to older varieties; however, they also have a very wide range of adaptation which is far greater than in most older varieties. There are vast areas in the world devoted to cereal production where the new high yielding varieties are not adaptedregions such as the Anatolian Plateau of Turkey where varieties with good winterhardiness and drouth resistance are required. A major effort is currently underway to develop  75  .such varieties and the necessary cultural practices to give maximum yields.  Perhaps the greatest criticism of the Green Revolution by some in the scientific community is that [these new varieties represent a [very narrow gene base, thus placing millions of acres in jeopardy if disease and insect epidemics should develop similar to the Southern corn leaf blight in the United States a few years ago. If one examines the actual situation, it is quite different. In most areas where the new varieties were introduced they were found to be as disease resistant as the local varieties. This was not by chance, but rather the result of an extensive testing program for disease resistance carried out during their development.  However, with regard to germ-plasm there is a re-:l danger that with the rapid acceptance of the new varieties, local land varieties will no longer be grown. Since these latter varieties contain a wealth of good genetic material including different sources for disease resistance needed in develop-  Reprinted from  magazine  Copyright 1975 by the American Society of Agronomy, Inc., 677 South Segoe Rd., Madison, Wisconsin 53711"},{"id":"p16022coll345:69541","object":"https://cdm16022.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/getthumbnail/collection/p16022coll345/id/69541","set_spec":"p16022coll345","collection_name":"Norman E.

Benefits  An additional point which is overlooked is that each year screening nurseries which contain thousands of diverse hnes are systematically sent out by various agencies. As a result plant breeders have greater access to germplasm today than ever before in the history of cereal improvement. Included as a part of this package is a worldwide surveillance for new diseases and possible new races of existing diseases. This is a cooperative effort involving not only scientists of various countries but also the research centers as the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center in Mexico (cimmyt) which coordinate these efforts.  One item frequently omitted when discussing the Green Revolution is that coupled with the development of new varieties has been an extensive training program for young scientists from the developing countries. This has included practical training in all aspects of cereal breeding and production conducted at centers such as CIMMYT and the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines, as well as more advanced graduate training for the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees at various universities. Already these dedicated young scientists have strengthened their national programs to the point where new varieties are being released which have been developed and tested under conditions of the local countries. This then negates the need to import large quantities of seed representing varieties developed elsewhere. These young people are the real hope of the future. A Chinese proverb is most appropriate in this context: \"\"Give me a  fish and I will nourish myself for a day. Teach me to fish and I will nourish myself all my life.\"\"  There is a more basic problem which goes far beyond the positive and negative features of the Green Revolution. In both the developed and developing countries, agriculture has been rele-  gated to the back seat and taken for p^rantpH Ip countries such as  the United States and Canada, agriculture hasTecome a victinroL its own effirienrv and prndurtivitv. We in agriculture must share the blame, for not telling our storv. In a recent letter appearing in \"\"Time\"\" magazine. Dr. J. George Harrar, a former president of the Rockefeller Foundation, wrote, If . A principal and persistant factor that has led to the international food crisis is the widespread failure to recognize that., agriculture is the basic world y-dustry and the major employer of-labor. Ti)ese facts have not been fully understood even though agriculture is the source of human, energy and the building blocks of life and health.^.' /y  Having participated in the Green Revolution in a very modest manner, I believe what this technological breakthrough has done is to place agriculture in its proper perspective. As Harrar pointed out, agriculture is basic to all countries and cultures. K the Green Revolution has done nothing: more than to focus the attention of people and govern-rnents toward agriculture as the backbone of society, it is truly a success.  The Green Revolution is no miracle as some people have read into the name. It will not solve all the economic, social, and poltical problems of the world. This technological breakthrough is a major contribution made through many years of dedication and hard work. It has provided a vehicle of hope for a better life to the less privi-  leged people of this earth.  When the announcement was made that a scientist who gets his nands dirty working in his profession had won the Nobel Peace Prize, all of us associated with agriculture stood a little taller. Norman Borlaug has clearly placed agriculture back in the limelight and at the same time he has thrown down the gauntlet for all of us, not only in agriculture but in all segments of the world's society, to make sure there are many Green Revolutions. One of these, hopefully, will be in the area of population control.  Perhaps Borlaug said it best with a rather simple statement, \"\"What is food worth when you don't have it?\"\"Warren E.

Alexander's involvement with the YMCA dates from 1946, when he was recruited as a youth leader for the Chestnut Street YMCA in Louisville, Kentucky. His YMCA career took him from Louisville to Chicago; Brooklyn, New York; and Washington, D.C. where he served in various roles including youth leader, young adult and adult leader, personnel officer, conference planner, trainer, consultant, and an executive at local and national YMCA headquarters. In 1968, Alexander helped organize the National Conference of Black and Non-white YMCA Volunteers and Staff (BAN-WYS), a group dedicated to supporting all efforts to overcome racism in the YMCA and to assuring that YMCA units continued to exist in non-white communities, and served as its executive director and advisor. He joined the staff of the national board in 1969, when he was appointed Associate Executive Director for Black and Non-White Concerns. His role in this position was to act as a kind of ombudsman to address concerns identified by BAN-WYS, as well as to provide leadership to YMCAs serving minority communities, and mediation in interracial and intraracial conflicts. In 1973, he became director of the Board's Human Rights Unit and the National YMCA's Affirmative Action Officer. He organized and directed the 1978 international observances of the 125th anniversary of the founding of the first YMCA in an African American community.He was director of the YMCA National Youth Governors Conferences in Washington D.C., and a delegate to the 6th World Council of YMCAs in Kampala, Uganda in 1973. After retiring from the YMCA's national board in 1981, Alexander joined the national staff of the United Church of Christ in New York City, but continued to be involved in the YMCA as a volunteer.","date_created":["1978"],"date_created_sort":"1978","creator":["Alexander, Jesse N."],"creator_sort":"alexanderjessen","notes":"Forms part of the African American Digital Collections: Digitizing African American Archival Materials Across Collections project.","types":["Mixed Material"],"subject":["African Americans Civil Rights","African Americans Segregation","African Americans Social Conditions","Civil Rights Workers","Young Men's Christian Associations","Race Relations","National Conference of Black and Non White Ymca Laymen and Staff","National Board of the Young Men's Christian Associations","Alexander, Jesse Nelson Jr"],"language":["English"],"country":["United States"],"continent":["North America"],"parent_collection":"Jesse Alexander Papers (Y.USA.6); http://purl.umn.edu/38283","parent_collection_name":"Jesse Alexander Papers (Y.USA.6)","contributing_organization":"University of Minnesota Libraries, Kautz Family YMCA Archives.","contributing_organization_name":"University of Minnesota Libraries, Kautz Family YMCA Archives.","contact_information":"University of Minnesota Libraries, Kautz Family YMCA Archives. 318 Elmer L.

There are several shaven-headed priests, the presiding genii of the place, who array themselves in front of the entrance to the temple, barring the way. But this is only to claim their privilege of making all the money they can out of a party of visitors. There is no fixed fee for seeing the bell, and the priests ask all they think they can get; but after a good deal of talking back and forth, matters are arranged, the doors opened, and the temple may be entered.  Such a barn-like place as it is 1unpainted walls and floor, and nothing at all there buttlie one thing, the bell. It is not hung in a tower, but is within reach from the floor; indeed, the floor is somewhat above the bell, and a pit is built under it. A pair of rickety winding stairs lead to a gallery that surrounds the bell, where one may look down upon it, and see the great wooden beam which holds it in place. The bell has no tongue, but is struck by a heavy beam swung on the outside. From the gallery a hole in the top of the bell is discovered, made so that under the heaviest ringing it will not be fractured.: And now is a chance to try ones fortune, since, if money can be thrown through the hole, it is considered a sure  j  t  1  There was never a time when Christianity had so strong a hold as at present on the educated minds of the world. There was never a time when the Bible was Accepted as bringing a revelation from God to man, by so many students of science as now accept it trustfully. One of the indications of progress in this direction is found in the improved Christian tone of our colleges in England and America. Important testimony, on this point, is now borne by Mr. Dwight L. Moody, in response to a question from the Editor of The Sunday School Times. Mr. Moodys opportunities for observation give added value to his encouraging exhibit of the facts in the case.  chosen selections, so given as to enforce a point, are most serviceable; but dont fill three-quarters of your hour with recitations (even though they are about giving, or sacrifice), and call it a missionary concert. Banish the idea that missionary intelligence is of itself so intrinsically dry-as-dust that it must be dealt in infinitesmally small doses, triply coated with poetry to make it palatable. Rightly told, the missionary story possesses a power to interest belonging to fow other topics.  Now for the  dos.  First: Do give your concert, in all the steps of its preparation, to the Lord Jesus, to be made of real service in advancing the missionary cause. Having done this, while you give to it your choicest energies remember that, regarded as a work of art, it will not be likely to be perfect. Few useful things are. Doubtless it will be marred by blemishes, failures, blunders, perhaps; but lie to whom you gave it-can use the mispronounced word, or other error, to fix a fact in many minds.  Second: Do make sure that the field considered is thoroughly scanned and Us important features presented, especially the recent events,those that have occurred since your school last studied the field. Has a laborei fallen?' Lot some one.brielly sketch that life, and tract its power in the darkness it sought to lighten. Has i new laborer entered the field ? Make his Acquaintance at the outset, and let his name be a definite center about which to fasten every event of importance'in his field ol labor. Have political events opened new avenues of approach, new points of nttaok?i Let some able mind trace the steps that have led to it, showing Gods band therein.  Let your business men' present statistics and facts in the clear practical light in which they will view them.  Thus let the hour be one in which from the watcb-1 tower you scan with keen accuracy the mighty opposing  force, noting also every inch gained by the force of I Christ's soldiers.  f Third: Do see to it that the varied talents of your i school contribute to the value of the exercise. Among . those gifts do pot forget childish grace. Let flip chll-, dren, even the tiny ones who can say but a few words,   tell of the flowers, the birds, the children, the strange customs, the sad ways of childhood, and the joy that i Jesuslove has'brought'tp. some: of those dark minds, i Choose your facts suitably; dress them in simple words that the youngest can understand,no parrot-like repetition,and a charm will be lent to your concert that : older lips cannot impart.

Utilizing drama, vignettes, and/or securing the services (free) of an actor to play the part of Anthony Bowen. It is felt that the Board deserves a real experience rather than a regular report. This would be a type of extravaganza that would highlight the year's activities.  There were a number of ideas generated for consideration by the committee. They are as follows:  1. This would be a good time to increase the number of  Black laymen on YMCA boards.  2. This would be a good time to increase the number of  memberships in YMCAs in Black communities.  3. All new board members should have a special orienta-  tion related to contributions of Blacks and YMCAs in Black communities.  4. This Anniversary program should be considered a COMMENCEMENT.  5. There should be nationwide publicity with all of the many multi-media possibilities.  6. Magazines such as Readers Digest might run articles on famous Black YMCA leaders.  7. Resolutions from national organizations like the N.A.A.C.P. should be sent to each of the local YMCAs for their information.  8. Program techniques should be developed for \"\"white\"\"  YMCAs that have Blacks in them.  9. There is a need for training around the history and culture of Black people for all YMCA laypeople and staff.  There was an agreement that the next meeting of this committee would be set for June.

Throughout 1978, YMCAs all over North America will be celebrating the 125th anniversary of the founding of the first YMCA for blacks anywhere in the world. This was in Washington, D.C. in 1853  ten years before the Emancipation Proclamation was signed  when Anthony Bowen, a freed man employed as a clerk in the U.S. Patent Office, organized the YMCA for Colored Men and Boys.  Locally, the Montciair YMCA is marking this anniversary along with an anniversary celebration of its own 73 years service to the black community and taking the opportunity to reflect on those years.  In the town of Montclair, preliminary plans for a Colored Branch were discussed at a YMCA board of directors meeting on April 17, 1903. The following February, 27 black men rented a small room on Bloomfield Ave. and began holding Sunday Bible classes. The program grew rapidly, soon requiring classes to meet on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday evenings as well as Sunday afternoons.  Authority was granted officially for organization of a Colored Branch on Feb. 20, 1905; and, that April, W.F. DeBar-delaben was hired as the first full-time executive director.  Anthony Bowen, 1809-1871, founder of the first YMCA for Colored Men and Boys, Washington, D.C. 1853.  The branch program was conducted in a variety of locations, including local church gymnasiums, until 1925 when a site on Washington St. was purchased for erecting a Colored Branch YMCA building.  In November 1959, the committee of management of the Washington Street Branch YMCA voted to integrate in all phases of activity and program. Assisted by national and regional YMCA personnel, a reorganization took place with a complete merger of membership, program and leadership of Park St. and Washington St. units, and the two became officially known as the YMCA of Montclair.  Todays YMCA serves men, women, boys and girls from throughout Montclair and surrounding communities. During National YMCA Week, Jan. 22-29, the Montclair YMCA will have a variety of activities in celebration of both anniversaries of service, and it has invited the public to participate, suggesting, as the national celebration slogan suggests:  Let us celebrate together ... 125 years of YMCA service to black communities . . . service that helps move our country toward fulfillment of its higher ideals.  125TH ANNIVERSARY  BLACK S SINCE 1853  Bible study classes in a rented room over the Harrison Market on Bloomfield Ave. opposite Park St. preceded establishment of a \"\"Colored Branch\"\" of the Montclair YMCA. This actually was the second location for the classes. The first, beginning in 1904, was in another rented room in the old \"\"Rink\"\" (skating) Building on Bloomfield Ave. near North Willow St. When the rink was destroyed by fire, the classes moved to the Harrison Market building.  This logo being used by the National YMCA for the 125th anniversary celebration of YMCA work among black people was designed by Ernest Uno, executive of the West Oahu Branch of the Honolulu YMCA. Symbolically, the logo is meant to convey the strength, solidity and movement forward and upward that are characteristics of YMCAs serving black communities.

A Modem That Got Away  BY JOAN FINN Like window shopping at Tiffany's or collecting travel brochures to exotic ports of call, a visit to the National Boat Show at the New York Coliseum has always ranked high on my list of fantasy wish fulfillments.  Where else could you lounge splendiferously aboard the regal main salon of a luxurious Chris-Craft cabin cruiser, admire the sleek, sweeping hull of a Grand Prix racer or sit taunt in the cockpit fighting chair of a 42-foot Hatteras Sport-fisherman...all for just the price of admission. |  It's no secret that over the past decade women have greatly influenced the whole field of boat design. By demanding more fully equipped galleys, microwave ovens and wider sleeping berths, they've challenged designers to bring the comforts of home to life afloat.  But, what impressed me most at this year's show was the inroads that women are now making into that last bastion of manliness...the time-honored, once male-dominated world of fishing.  It seems the gals have really taken up the sport. And with some 22 million women who have already applied for fresh water fishing licenses last year and the untold numbers who now go deep sea fishing, you can rest assured that their influence has already taken hold in the commercial market.  One Boat Show exhibitor who deals in boating attire and fishing tackle has designed a special line of nautical togs for women along with some lightweight spinning and casting rods with handles to fit a smaller palm. The handles come in a variety of pastel colors that, according to one old-salt I overheard, \"\"would turn a man's stomach and make him seasick. Even worse,\"\" he commented, \"\"they've got fancy fishing outfits in matching colors.\"\"  New England Women  The Montclair Colony, National Society of New England Women, will meet at the Montclair Womens Club, 82 Union St., on Thursday, at 2 P.M.

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20009 202-462-1054  THE FIRST YMCA ESTABLISHED FOR BLACK PEOPLE ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD  A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE ANTHONY BOWEN BRANCH Y.M.C.A.  The YMCA movement was begun in London, England on June 6, 1844 by George Williams and his followers in response to the spiritual and social needs of young men coming to the newly industrialized city. The movement spread very rapidly coming to the City of Washington in 1852. Chauncey Lang-don and Anthony Bowen, fellow clerks in the U.S. Patent Office, were instrumental in founding the two original Associations here. Langdon in 1852 founded the YMCA for white men and boys (now Central Branch).  Bowen and a group of friends organized the YMCA For Colored Men and Boys in August 1853. This was the first YMCA established for blacks anywhere in the world. It is noteworthy that this early example of self help occurred more than 10 years before the Emancipation Proclamation of President Abraham Lincoln.  This YMCA was incorporated on June 6, 1892 and during its early development occupied quarters at 1609 Eleventh Street, N.W. and 12th and \"\"U\"\" Streets, N.W. The erection of the present building was begun in 1908 after a community fund raising campaign. Black citizens of Washington contributed $27,000 toward the cost. Julius Rosenwald (of the Sears, Roebuck, Co.) and John D. Rockefeller (Standard Oil) each contributed $25,000 toward the $110,000 needed for construction. The building was dedicated on May 19, 1912. President Theodore Roosevelt delivered the principal address at the cornerstone laying. The Honorable Henry L. Stimson, $ecretary of War represented President Howard Taft in delivering the dedicatory address. The new facility became known as the Twelfth Street YMCA. It contained four stories and a basement, fully equipped for residence service, meal service, aquatic and athletic facilities, social and meeting rooms, lounges, bowling alleys and executive and business offices. The Executive Secretary of the new building was Lewis E. Johnson.","page_count":0,"record_type":"secondary","parent_id":"p16022coll416:904","first_viewer_type":"image","viewer_type":"image","child_index":34,"attachment":"849.jp2","document_type":"item","featured_collection_order":999,"date_added":"2018-11-14T00:00:00Z","date_added_sort":"2018-11-14T00:00:00Z","date_modified":"2018-11-14T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"p16022coll416:849","object":"https://cdm16022.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/getthumbnail/collection/p16022coll416/id/849","set_spec":"p16022coll416","collection_name":"Jesse Alexander Papers","collection_description":"Papers documenting the YMCA career of Jesse N.

Moreland who came to this position in the early 1890's.  By action of the Board of Management at the meeting of September 27, 1972 the name of the Branch was changed from the 12th Street Branch to the Anthony Bowen Branch of the YMCA of Metropolitan Washington.  The services of the Branch have always been directed toward the needs of young men and boys and in recent years the entire family. In the post World War II period until the present, the specific emphasis has been on dealing with community problems and concerns. The Urban Crisis became the number one priority of the Washington Association in mid 1960. Today, the crises of the community are to improve the quality of the environment of our city and to eliminate institutional and cultural racism in our society. The newly named Anthony Bowen Branch YMCA is involved with Board, Staff and Community leadership paving the way for a better community, a better city, a better nation and better world.  ANTHONY BOWEN 1809-1871 FOUNDER (A Biographical Sketch)  Anthony Bowen, one of four sons of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Bowen, was born into slavery in 1809 on the estate of William Bradley, Prince George County, Maryland.  1826 saw young Bowen move to Washington a free man and later that year purchase the freedom of his first wife, Catherine Miles. This marriage produced three girls, and four years following the death of his first wife, his marriage to Mary Collins gave him seven children.  Anthony Bowen's trailblazing came early in his life when he was able to get one of his sons and another free Negro youth into the U.S. Navy. History was to see his son James serve in the U.S. Coast Guard and be among the first graduates of the Howard University Medical School in 1871 as valedictorian.  In 1841, Anthony Bowen was employed by the federal government and a succession of promotions saw him rise to become the first Negro clerk in the U.S. Patent Office where he remained until his death.  DATELINE:  1839 Bowen sponsored and obtained permits for free Negroes of the District to conduct meetings at what became known as \"\"The Colored Peoples Meeting House\"\" located at 7th and D Streets, S.W., Washington, D.C.  1845 Anthony Bowen and Enoch Ambush opened a Sunday School at Wesley Church in Southwest Washington.  1847 Bowen opened a Sunday Evening School for free black men where they studied reading, writing, and bible instruction.  1853 Bowen worked in the Patent Office with William Chauncy Longdon, the first Corresponding Secretary and a Member of the Board of Managers of the Young Men's Christian Association established in Washington, D.C. in 1852. This type of community activity interested Bowen and, collaborating with Longdon, he organized and became the first President of the Young Men's Christian Association for Colored Men and Boys in 1853. He was aided in this venture by John F.  Cook and other free men.","page_count":0,"record_type":"secondary","parent_id":"p16022coll416:904","first_viewer_type":"image","viewer_type":"image","child_index":35,"attachment":"850.jp2","document_type":"item","featured_collection_order":999,"date_added":"2018-11-14T00:00:00Z","date_added_sort":"2018-11-14T00:00:00Z","date_modified":"2018-11-14T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"p16022coll416:850","object":"https://cdm16022.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/getthumbnail/collection/p16022coll416/id/850","set_spec":"p16022coll416","collection_name":"Jesse Alexander Papers","collection_description":"Papers documenting the YMCA career of Jesse N.

Anthony Bowen and other free men petitioned the Mayor to provide free public schools for Negro children and, with the assistance of white supporters, carried the petition to Congress. To augment these efforts, Bowen donated land to the District to use in this venture. In 1867 Congress appropriated funds for the first free public school for Negro children. This school, located at Second and M Streets, S.W. was named for Anthony Bowen following his death in 1871 and has remained there to the present.

The \"\"YMCA for Colored Men and Boys\"\" was incorporated in 1892; and the present building at 1816 Twelfth Street, N.W. in Washington, D.C. was dedicated in 1912 as the Twelfth Street YMCA. The name was changed to the Anthony Bowen Branch YMCA in 1972 in honor of its Founder.  This YMCA was born in a time of turmoil in this country. It was a time when black leaders had to create their own institutions because they could not belong to white institutions. Through the years black YMCA leaders have had numerous bitter experiences of trying to desegregate and to correct \"\"unchristian\"\" behavior on the part of white YMCA leaders. Although the separate YMCAs were created because there was no choice  black leaders feeling that all Christian brothers and sisters should be as one  these self-help institutions did, in fact, provide fertile ground for the development of moral, intellectual and spiritual qualities in many of the country's potential black leaders. Black YMCA leaders challenged youth to aim high and to aspire to impossible goals. Black young people were thus prepared to enter a white world full of confidence in themselves and knowledgeable and proud of their racial heritage.  Today, there are 13 9 black communities with YMCAs. The present leaders of these YMCAs, other leaders of other local YMCAs, regional YMCA leaders, national YMCA leaders and international YMCA leaders have begun to reflect on the great legacy that past black YMCA leaders have bequeathed to the present generation. The struggle then was to desegregate.  The struggle today is to eliminate racism. And for black YMCAs there is also the struggle to survive. The number of black communities with YMCAs has grown smaller. The influence of the Y on the lives of black youth has diminished. The potential for making an impact on 140 plus black communities is great if Y resources can be mobilized.  The National Conference of Black and Non-White YMCA laymen and Staff (BAN-WYS) at its annual conference in November 1975 proposed that the entire YMCA observe 197 8 as a special time to reflect on the past and plan for the future.

It has been noted by some of today's black leaders, that there is a great danger of losing a whole generation of people. They have seen the trauma of urbanization and repeated disappointments that have eroded the moral and spiritual foundations of black communities  particularly black youth. This time in history, more than any other, presents challenges to YMCA leaders of all races unlike those any other generation has faced.  Today's black community needs men and women who can stand shoulder to shoulder and toe to toe with black youth to tell them and to show them that folk care. Black youth must be confronted with a spirit of love. Black youth must learn that the pursuit of excellence is first and foremost.  Early YMCA leaders knew the importance of persuasive symbols in guiding and challenging young people. They set examples and insisted that others follow. These times require leaders with new forms, structures and programs. These times also require a revival of the spirit, the culture, the community and the need for competence.

A number of these could well remain relevant long after the celebrations are over, effecting the quality of life for many people, among them people who have never been touched by Y services before. Here are a few action ideas as a start.  Assess your Association's present knowledge of and commitment to the black community. If you are already working with black people, there is probably still value in learning even more about the community and your commitment to it. If not, this should probably be your first task.  There are individuals in your Y or in the community who might well be interested in working on this project.  Establish a task force on Minority Family Life Concerns, with major leadership coming from black staff and/or volunteers. Set up adequate time and resources for meetings.  Make other staff available as needed. Give top priority to recommendations offered by the task force.  Evaluate the kinds of jobs held by black people in the  Y and in the community. Begin to develop programs to improve their status: special workshops, classes, conferences,  seminars, scholarship awards; recommendations to personnel offices, agencies, corporations; opportunities within the  Y itself.  Publish information from facts you have gathered. Use resources from the community for data, sponsorship and promotion. Contact other agencies, organizations, etc. for assistance .  Develop specific projects: employment of youth, counsel-  ing, youth and adult training programs, programs related to health, nutrition, consumer education.  Establish resource centers in your community under Y sponsorship. (A good collaborative project.)  Institute an ethnic heritage study program. Establish links with organizations such as ASALH (The Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History), NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People), Urban League, churches serving the black community.","page_count":0,"record_type":"secondary","parent_id":"p16022coll416:904","first_viewer_type":"image","viewer_type":"image","child_index":42,"attachment":"857.jp2","document_type":"item","featured_collection_order":999,"date_added":"2018-11-14T00:00:00Z","date_added_sort":"2018-11-14T00:00:00Z","date_modified":"2018-11-14T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"p16022coll416:857","object":"https://cdm16022.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/getthumbnail/collection/p16022coll416/id/857","set_spec":"p16022coll416","collection_name":"Jesse Alexander Papers","collection_description":"Papers documenting the YMCA career of Jesse N.

RESEARCH TECHNIQUES  Basic exposure to research processes, how and where to secure needed factual information, how to synthesize the materials gained, evaluation of the validity and usefulness of information acquired and the production of a written document.  Models of Afro-American programs  A number of \"\"Afro-American\"\" programs have been developed over the past few years. Some are based on existing programs but revised to reflect the Afro-American culture.  The \"\"Follow Me\"\" program as described below does not reflect this Afro-American emphasis but could easily do so.  \"\"FOLLOW ME\"\"  \"\"Follow Me\"\" is a program designed primarily for urban males.  It seeks to bring men and boys together through informal activities, providing the young person with a positive adult model to emulate. The program operates at its best with young people 6 to 12 years old and adults 18 years and up.  A staff or layperson can serve equally well as director of the program. His primary duties are: to interpret \"\"Follow Me\"\"  to parents, YMCA membership and the community; to find an adult for each youth (if not possible, the maximum ratio should be 3 to 1); to present an orientation and ongoing training program for the adults; to organize transportation, program, and facilities for participants; and to design a program evaluation process which would get responses from all participants to be judged against the \"\"Follow Me\"\" goals.  Ideally, activities, except for movies, trips, etc., should take place at the Y on a bi-weekly (or more) basis and should last at least 90 minutes. They might include: ping pong, pool,  checkers, swimming, crafts, softball, volleyball, refreshments, etc.  Expenses might include: staff time, program rental space,  transportation, sports equipment, \"\"T\"\" shirts. It is recommended that there be no registration or program fee for participants.  AFRICAN GUIDES  A developmental program, African Guides is based on the National Y-Indian Guide program, but built around the Afro-American culture. (It can be adopted, as was Y-Indian Guides, for mother/daughter, father/daughter, etc.) Reuben Davis prepared and used a manual for African Guides several years ago which has been revised and updated since.

The purpose of this Afro-Guide program is to build strong families through work with father and sons or older male/younger male relationsips. The participants of the program are organized into Nations (Kabiles). The Swahili terms are used for designing clubs and officers, and each participant adopts a Swahili name.  To be meaningful, the program should provide both a place and environment where the father and son or male individuals both work and play together . . . building a stronger line of communication and understanding and thus creating a stronger family and extended family tie.  If you are working on an \"\"Afro-Guides\"\" program, the National Board would like to receive data concerning your experiences as it continues to develop this program. Please send information to Elsie Gibbs, Urban Action and Program Division, 291 Broadway,  New York, New York 10007.  A FAMILY REUNION  In this model, the families involved provide much of the leadership themselves. Some YMCA leadership is needed, however, to initiate and assist in planning.  The objectives of the program are: To acquaint the younger  generations with the history, traditions and experiences of the family. To celebrate God's blessings on the family. To have fun and fellowship with each other. To begin to develop a story(ies), a family symbol, a family slogan and a family song(s). To develop an historical account of the family.  Program possibilities include: Talent show  dramatic  presentations, poetry readings, songs, etc. Dialogues by senior family members about their childhood and their hopes for the future. Family banquet with recognitions for achievements, etc. Family communion and memorial service  remembrance of family forebears, etc. Family meetings.  One excellent program possibility is an artifacts display.

It was convened to confront the YMCA with the necessity of immediately coping with the organization's practices related to Non-Whites - such practices as were already conceded to be wrong by many YMCA leaders, Non-White and white, lay and staff.  Subsequent developments may prove this meeting to have been the most rewarding and beneficial event for Non-White YMCA leadership, both laymen and staff. The YMCA Movement itself will benefit as it responds to the mandate of the Atlanta Conference. The YMCA itself in many parts of the country has already begun to take stock of its practices and policies which made this Atlanta Conference a necessity for Non-White staff. Indeed the National Board of YMCAs, and some local YMCAs, have taken steps to support and respond to the recommendations of the Conference.  The Atlanta Conference was perceived, planned, and carried out with the central focus on making the YMCA more aware, sensitive, relevant, and responsive to the unmet needs of Black and other Non-White persons in cities of the United States. The YMCAs in the United States are historically and presently perceived by Non-Whites as being a white oriented and dominated Movement. Non-White YMCA staff do not see the white leaders and management of YMCAs as being sensitive to the ambitions, concerns, interests, hopes, and needs of Non-White laymen and staff.  The Atlanta Conference was called to develop a composite strategy for nation-wide confrontation with YMCA leaders at all levels about the YMCA's practices with Non-White people. For nation-wide action and results, a confrontation with his Executive Director and local YMCA Board and staff is expected of each Non-White YMCA staff member who attended the Atlanta Conference.  The thrust of the Atlanta Conference was consistent and forthright and sharply focused on:  - How to make the YMCA effective and relevant in coping with the crucial problems of Non-White and white relationship in the United States; how to improve and upgrade the position or status of Non-White and other Non-White people related to the YMCA, as either laymen or professional staff. The planning and action thrusts were consistently directed within the YMCA structure.  - The failure of the YMCA, even in times of serious racial crisis in United States' cities throughout the country, to utilize - except in a limited way - the leadership resources of Black and other Non-White laymen.  - 1 -","page_count":0,"record_type":"secondary","parent_id":"p16022coll416:904","first_viewer_type":"image","viewer_type":"image","child_index":18,"attachment":"833.jp2","document_type":"item","featured_collection_order":999,"date_added":"2018-11-14T00:00:00Z","date_added_sort":"2018-11-14T00:00:00Z","date_modified":"2018-11-14T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"p16022coll416:834","object":"https://cdm16022.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/getthumbnail/collection/p16022coll416/id/834","set_spec":"p16022coll416","collection_name":"Jesse Alexander Papers","collection_description":"Papers documenting the YMCA career of Jesse N.

It is also essential that YMCA people and others learn the significances of the work of YMCAs in Black communities. However, it is the future that we are aiming toward as we work to implement this most significant activity.  J. Rupert Picott of the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History (ASALH) briefed the committee on the history of the development of this Association. He gave a brief sketch of its founder, Carter G. Woodson; and he reviewed the 1978 National Afro-American History Kit, which contains the booklet, \"\"Selected Black Leaders of the YMCA\"\" by Jesse N. Alexander, Jr. and Leo B. Marsh. He proposed that the 139 Chapters of ASALH would be willing to form collaborative agreements with local YMCAs. He also proposed that we should consider printing the booklet \"\"Selected Leaders of the YMCA\"\" in thousands of copies for distribution to people who would desire the information. He indicated a willingness to prepare historic markers on YMCA leaders as they have already done on William A. Hunton; and a willingness to assist us in the development of our history of the development of the YMCA for Black people.  Richard Barber and Everett Christmas reported on the activities of BAN-WYS related to this anniversary. BAN-WYS was designed to help the YMCA become more sensitive to the needs of non-whites as perceived by them. BAN-WYS sees this anniversary celebration as the means for setting the tone and direction for the next 125 years. At the 1977 conference BAN-WYS broke from tradition and extended an open invitation to all persons to attend the Banquet.  The Anthony Bowen commemorative stein was introduced at the Banquet, which kicked off the BAN-WYS observation of this anniversary. The 11th Annual BAN-WYS Conference is scheduled for October 18-21, 1978 in Washington, D.C. An open invitation will be extended to all persons. The Conference theme is: \"\"A Quest for Excellence.\"\" BAN-WYS  feels that it is most important that the National Board Committee have its own budget in order to have the proper financing for the many excellent programs that are being planned.  The International Division Seminars to West Africa for approximately 100 business and professional persons for late August or early September is being directed by Henrv Lenoir, of the YMCA of Greater New York. The committee suggested that consideration should be given to the fact that Senegal is a French-speaking country and there may be some serious limitations for persons from the U.S. to communicate effectively there. A second trip to West Africa designed for high school and college age young people is planned for 4 weeks in July or August. The committee felt that less time should be spent in Dakar and more time should be spent in Nigeria. It was reported that Ms. Yvonne J. Butler of the Baltimore YMCA is the staff person responsible for this trip. It was suggested that the youth groups should have groups of 15 and therefore the international air carriers  ASALH REPORT 1978 KIT AND YMCA BOOKLET  BAN-WYS REPORT 1978 CONFERENCE  I.D.

Dunbar Reed and Robert Dye were assigned to act as staff aides to the sub-committee. Richard Kaeyer was asked to chair this group.  James Tompkins reported on the Association of Professional Director plans. The committee made several suggestions after hearing the report. One, that the article that is to be serialized in the \"\"PERSPECTIVE\"\" should be reviewed by several people to determine its worthiness to represent the anniversary. Jim PI inton indicated that he would like to see the article. It was suggested that articles that appear in the A.P.D. journal should have reprints made so that other people who are not A.P.D. members may see them. It was also suggested that A.P.D. consider recognizing Violet Henry in addition to Leo Marsh.  Wilbert Myles reported on the work on the National Anthony Bowen Award for Excellence. The committee agreed that this would be a most worthy award. The comments included that it would be most important to keep this award at a very high level so that it becomes a very real incentive. It was also indicated that those who would have the honor and responsibility of being national judges must be perceived as very important personages.  A leaflet on the YMCA of Montclair's special YMCA Week Program in honor of the 125th Anniversary was distributed. The Montclair YMCA is one of the national models that is being utilized for other Member YMCAs to learn one method of observing the 125th.  Ms. Joel P. Martin and her associate, Awilda Fosse, made a marketing presentation to the committee. The company's capabilities were demonstrated and proposals to help the YMCA were made. The report was well received and the members were very favorably impressed. The J. P. Martin Associates have been very helpful to us so far; and is presently negotiating with the Southeast Region to assist them with their work related to the 125th Anniversary. It was indicated how important it is to have a consultant help to assist us in communicating properly with YMCA constituents first and other people who would assist us secondly.  One of the new activities that is being contemplated is a symposium on the future needs of YMCAs in Black communities, particularly personnel. This is conceived as being a collaborative venture between the National Board of YMCAs, BAN-WYS and A.P.D.  Another activity that will receive additional expansion is the selection of and negotiation with additional collaborators in this program. The Black churches, the Black colleges and the Black YMCAs in the earlier days worked very closely together. It would seem very appropriate that these institutions become collaborators with us. In addition, the N.A.A.C.P., the Urban League and other similar organizations are also a part of the history of the YMCA in Black communities.  WAYS & MEANS  COMMITTEE  APPOINTED  A.P.D.

It would be preferable to use Monrovia as an introduction and use Nigeria as the primary place for a work camp experience.  Robert Dye reported on the proposed special scholarship program for Black staff. He and Dunbar Reed are working together to secure funds. Robert Harlan has written to George Williams and Springfield Colleges concerning the possibility of setting up special scholarship funds in the name of Anthony Bowen. Second, it is hoped that funds can be raised from other sources and designated for this purpose. Third, local YMCAs will be asked to designate some of their regular scholarships for this purpose. Fourth, to request from our National Scholarship and Fellowship Committee some action in this regard. Dick Kaeyer reported on a traveling scholarship program for architecture students at Columbia, which illustrates the different types of special scholarships that might be available for students to do certain kinds of studies that might be very useful for our purposes. It was reported that some of the Black colleges are receiving funds from HEW for compensatory education, and that this might be explored for our use also. There was a concern expressed about the designation of scholarship funds for Black students only. Does this expose the YMCA to charges of reverse discrimination? It was the opinion of the group that this is not a major concern; and this should not prevent our pursuit, with vigor, of the goal of developing the scholarship fund.  The Program-CommuniKit that was sent in advance to all committee members was reviewed and commented on by Elsie Gibbs and Joe Pisarro. The National Board Program-Comnunikit and the ASALH History Kit have been viewed as providing excellent resources for staff and volunteers for the 125th Anniversary program. It was reported that approximately 4,000 extra Program-CommuniKits have been ordered for distribution so far. It was reported that the National Board newsletter \"\"MONDAY\"\" utilizes the new 125th Anniversary logo; and the January 9th issue will carry a special report on the 125th Anniversary.  There are plans to develop a brochure that will present a national profile of the YMCA in the Black communities. This will be available to whomever would like to use it; and would, hopefully, provide new insights and a new perspective on the nature of the YMCA resource in Black communities.  Dunbar Reed reported on the work that the Regions are doing to prepare special observations during their regional assemblies, as well as the work they plan to do with Member YMCAs. Regions are preparing also to assist YMCAs in Black communities in their financial and other needs throughout the year.

This means a growth rate of 7.1 percent each year for the decade. The actual grovjth rate in consumption was 8.8% in each year from crop year 19 6-465 to 19 70-71. One of the problems in most of these forecasts is that they are based on previous trends and there has been a very sharp use ii the needs of developing countries. This has led to'an exponential growth r-ate rather than one based , on an arithmetic increase which is more typical of the developed countries.

Usually this will require addition of chemical* N if the breakdown is to be made in reasonable time. The fallacy of applying raw organic matter just before sowing a crop is known to agronomists all over the world. The plant yield is determined largely by the fertility absorbed in the first 1-2 months of its life or in a winter crop effectively the same length of active growing time. It is during this period that the organic matter is also being broken down and the microorganisms concerned are in competition for the nutrients available. Hence yield is reduced unless additional nutrients are provided. On the death of the organisms the products of breakdown are released for plant use. *These may increase protein percentage but have no effect on yield. In one experiment an the tropics equal amounts of fertility by chemical determination in organic matter were compared wiuh chemical fertilizer. In each of the seven years in which these plots were compared and in each year the same treatment was repeated, the organically manured plot was uniformly lower in yield.

However, it was a long and hard road since culture tended to be location specific and for thousands of years these centres were preyed upon by looters who still followed a nomadic existence and periodically raided these centres for spoils. This led to a banding together of centres or societies into mutual protection groups which eventually formed under kingships, rudimentary democracies and other groupings. Slavery and semi-slavery became common in order to sustain societies and men sold their freedom for physical protection.  This basic element persists in modified forms to this day, in our own societies, although abject slavery has essentially disappeared.","page_count":0,"record_type":"secondary","parent_id":"p16022coll345:69542","first_viewer_type":"image","viewer_type":"image","child_index":269,"attachment":"69464.jp2","document_type":"item","featured_collection_order":999,"date_added":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","date_added_sort":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","date_modified":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"p16022coll345:69465","object":"https://cdm16022.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/getthumbnail/collection/p16022coll345/id/69465","set_spec":"p16022coll345","collection_name":"Norman E.

Food could be grown by and large to meet needs.  One interesting aspect is that because of the. severe, winters, the temperate zone peoples through force of circumstances were forced to grow crops beyond their immediate need to store for the winter when no food was available and even beyond this to maintain surpluses to carry them accross unfavourable years of production. In the tropics and subtropics, however, this need was absent since people could grow food of one type or another almost year around. The same pressures that prevailed in the temperate zone, were not present. Although people were' still preoccupied with growing food, storing food was not considered necessary.  Exceptions to this rule occurred in the more severe environments of higher altitudes. In the Inca Empire for example, the Inca decreed that.the finest farmland be cultivated for religion mainly to. provide vast quantities of food and textiles to be burned as offerings. The second share supplied government storehouses with grain for use in war or famine.

The farmer adopts the mentality that the government must look after him; if coun^tries adjacent to a country with this policy do not have a subsidy, fertilizer is 'often smuggled and sold across the border into the non-subsidized market. By contrast to this system, I consider that it is much better to establish a sound market floor price that ensures a good return to the farmer, then allow the input price to reflect the market and adjust the floor price periodically to compensate. If subsidy is to be paid at all it should be at the consvimer end through government selling of the produce directly on ration to the consumer. Such a system reduces bureaucracy and more surely protects th^ farmer and consumer. A stable floor price announced well before seeding will allow the farm.er to decide what level of expenditure he will incur and still have an assurance of a reason-i^ahle return. Anpther anomaly which is observed is the setting of a support price which is unreasonably low in one country as compared to its neighbours.  This encourages and results in an unnecessary smuggling of grain across country borders. This low support price is usually associated with a subsidy on inputs so that the country loses on both scores -the fertilizer flowing out and the product flowing out.

The stated value system has seven principles:  \"\"1. UNITY - strive for and maintain unity in the family, community, nation and race.  2. SELF DETERMINATION - to define ourselves, name ourselves, decide on our future.  3. COLLECTIVE WORK AND RESPONSIBILITY - build and maintain  our community together and make the problems of our brothers and sisters our own and work to solve them together.  4. COOPERATIVE ECONOMICS - build and maintain our stores, shops and other businesses and profit together from them.  5. PURPOSE - make, as our collective vocation, the building and developing of our community to restore our people to their traditional greatness.  6. CREATIVITY - do always as much as we can in such a way that we leave our community more beautiful and beneficial than when we inherited it.  7. FAITH - believe with all our he-arts in our parents, teachers, leaders and in the righteousness and victory of our struggle.\"\"  Each day of the Kwanza celebration represents one of the seven principles. As members of the family gather together at supper time, they light a candle and discuss one of the seven principles. The house is decorated in the color scheme of red, black and green. Red represents the black struggle and the blood of black ancestors. Black represents the true color of the race. Green represents youth and renewed life.  On January 1, the last day of Kwanza, a big dinner is held with a song and dance. Gifts are presented, especially for the children who have lived up to their commitments.

A PROCESS FOR PLANNING  A lay staff program committee might designate a meeting expressly devoted to consideration of ways ip which teenagers might be better involved in their society, especially black and other non-white teenagers. Such a meeting would include input such as:  1. Youth of non-white, less advantaged communities, tend to be less informed and less interested in the political nature of our society than are others, which build a potential of non-participation as citizens.  2. Youth of non-white, less advantaged communities are likely to have fewer financial resources and be less inclined  to expend them in such activities as the YMCA's Youth and Government.  3. Innovation of Youth and Government models can occur locally and be related to town, city and county government as well as international themes.  4. Many Youth and Government type programs are now in existence: State Youth and Government programs, Model  United Nations programs, local Youth and Government programs, National Affairs Conference, etc.  The planning committee should utilize consultant help from neighboring YMCAs, Management Service Centers, Regions or BAN-WYS, in considering this challenge.  A first step would be to determine one or more clear objectives for any program moves. This would be followed by: determining action steps to achieve objectives; assessing and identifying lay, staff and material resources needed; and recommending appropriate final action to the responsible lay group and executive director.

State Youth and Government committees should consider how the number of less advantaged youth involved in their programs could be increased and assured a quality, learning experience.  8. Local YMCA program directors are the key to planning with committees, in carrying out decisions and in influencing teenagers to become active in government-related learning programs as described.  9. Financial assistance to less advantaged youth would be important in encouraging them to enter into these activities with which they may be only vaguely familiar and have little interest in.  The 125th Anniversary of YMCA service to black communities in the United States can become a springboard for a YMCA program initiative to start enlarging more rapidly the reservoir of young Americans who are knowledgeable about, interested in and committed to their country's democratic processes  and especially those who are non-white.  Creative models/programs/centers  The following are some samples of the creative and innovative talents of YMCA people  primarily black  who are dedicated to the struggle to REPOSITION/REVITALIZE/RENEW black communities through the YMCA. This is not a complete list, but it illustrates the energies being devoted toward supporting the black family and teaching black youth to \"\"walk tall.\"\" If you want material on how any of these Ys are operating these programs, write and ask them.","page_count":0,"record_type":"secondary","parent_id":"p16022coll416:904","first_viewer_type":"image","viewer_type":"image","child_index":55,"attachment":"870.jp2","document_type":"item","featured_collection_order":999,"date_added":"2018-11-14T00:00:00Z","date_added_sort":"2018-11-14T00:00:00Z","date_modified":"2018-11-14T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"p16022coll416:870","object":"https://cdm16022.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/getthumbnail/collection/p16022coll416/id/870","set_spec":"p16022coll416","collection_name":"Jesse Alexander Papers","collection_description":"Papers documenting the YMCA career of Jesse N.

It is expected you will see ways to change them, or will be sparked by reading these to come up with your own, appropriate to your indigenous situation.  1. WORK WITH A COMMITTEE - Assign a committee including Y staff and citizens in the community to meet several weeks in advance to plan an observance program. This committee should consist of black and white persons, both sexes, youth and adults. Collaborate with other groups in the community (as stated above). Suggest that the committee# after the events, evaluate and discuss how to follow  up with community programs to deal with racism.  2. EXHIBIT - Appoint an \"\"Exhibit Committee\"\" to plan and set up an exhibit in the entrance lobby of the Y building and/or other prominent place in the community.  (See attached guide for some suggested materials.)  3. USE OF FILMS AND RECORDINGS - All films and records may be used in a variety of programs. They should be a  part of the session. Design a group experience that makes use of these, or sections of them, as part of the session. (See attached guide of suggested films and recordings.)  4. GROUP DIALOGUES - Set aside this period in each community to bring together board members, staff members, and persons from the community-at-large, white and non-white, young and old, in sessions of inter-personal involvement and human exposure. Plan for day-long and weekend sessions. Include plans for dialogues in various constituencies (youth groups, Y's Men, Parent/Child programs, etc.).  Check with your Regional Office, well in advance, on the availability of the YMCA Kit, \"\"A Confrontation/Search Laboratory on Black-White Intergroup Relations.\"\"  Utilize all or sections of this Kit; the opening tape alone would be useful. Use films and recordings (see attached list) as stimulators. Be prepared with other resource documents, provocative questions and statements.  5. YOUTH FESTIVAL - involving music, art, dancing. Invite  a local rock band to give a concert at the local shopping center or other central community area. Locate other youth talent. Appoint a Publicity Committee well in advance to help secure talent. Invite the local press and TV to attend and photograph the event.  6.

A recognition of Dr. King's birthday by the YMCA joining with other community groups could have profound significance. The joining of whites with their black brothers in this observance could be one more step to heal the racial fractures that have so polarized our nation in recent years. Such recognition at this time would be significant not only for the black community but for the total metropolitan community.  In America, the man whose name stands totally for peace in the eyes of the world is Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  In these days of violent conflict and social change, Dr. King's dream, which was rooted in the American dream of justice and equality, must not be permitted to die. This observance of his birthday is one way of saying to all America that we are really working to move away from two separate societies toward one society that will embrace the total family of man  dedicated to the principles of peace, justice and brotherhood.  THINGS TO DO TO MAKE THIS DAY COUNT  At the meeting of the National Board of YMCAs in February 197 0 action was taken asking that the National staff provide help for local Associations \"\"which will make . . . an observance meaningful and advance the causes to which the life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was dedicated.\"\" The National Office is closed on January 15, and the National Board proposed that local YMCAs also declare this day an official holiday.  In addition to plans for observance by your own Association, consider these suggestions also for community-wide programs, and plan in conjunction with other organizations. Check with local representatives of the NAACP and other Civil Rights groups for a collaborative program.","page_count":0,"record_type":"secondary","parent_id":"p16022coll416:904","first_viewer_type":"image","viewer_type":"image","child_index":62,"attachment":"877.jp2","document_type":"item","featured_collection_order":999,"date_added":"2018-11-14T00:00:00Z","date_added_sort":"2018-11-14T00:00:00Z","date_modified":"2018-11-14T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"p16022coll416:879","object":"https://cdm16022.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/getthumbnail/collection/p16022coll416/id/879","set_spec":"p16022coll416","collection_name":"Jesse Alexander Papers","collection_description":"Papers documenting the YMCA career of Jesse N.

SUPPORTING THE BLACK SPIRIT  by  Jesse N.

The National Board and its Member YMCAs has spent millions of dollars  some private and some public funds  over the last two decades confronting youth gangs, drugs, unemployment, and other evils caused by poverty, racism, lack of proper education, antiquated welfare systems, poor health, lack of recreational programs, overcrowding, etc. Our whole approach has been to think of the words ghetto, inner city or center city as meaning violence, crime, drugs, poverty, unemployment and other evils.  There is no question that these evils do exist. And we were right to attempt to do all we could to make our impact on them.  But it appears to me, as I have caught on to the spirit of this 125th Anniversary Observance, that we have overlooked something more powerful that existed in these neighborhoods. That was the spirit  the spirit that has fought the evils of crime, violence, drugs, poverty, filth and racism day in and day out over the years. There is a spirit in people who live in these communities  who, working against crushing obstacles make these communities their homes.","page_count":0,"record_type":"secondary","parent_id":"p16022coll416:904","first_viewer_type":"image","viewer_type":"image","child_index":72,"attachment":"887.jp2","document_type":"item","featured_collection_order":999,"date_added":"2018-11-14T00:00:00Z","date_added_sort":"2018-11-14T00:00:00Z","date_modified":"2018-11-14T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"p16022coll416:884","object":"https://cdm16022.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/getthumbnail/collection/p16022coll416/id/884","set_spec":"p16022coll416","collection_name":"Jesse Alexander Papers","collection_description":"Papers documenting the YMCA career of Jesse N.

The name of the Y was subsequently changed to the 12th Street Branch of the YMCA of Washington, D.C. and is presently the Anthony Bowen Branch.  Today, the word \"\"colored\"\" is rarely used. However, to be historically accurate, we have used the exact name of the YMCA Anthony Bowen founded in 1853.  And a word regarding the symbol or logo of the 125th Anniversary:  The original design was created by Ernest Uno, executive of the West Oahu Branch of the Honolulu YMCA. Symbolically, the logo is meant to convey the strength, solidity and movement forward and upward that are characteristics of YMCAs serving black communities. The stylized hand forms a Y, which cradles the YMCA triangle. We hope YMCAs will make wide use of this logo as they help celebrate this historic occasion.

(In some instances the Black YMCA was overlooked.) We have forgotten that the majority of these people are hard working; and that over the years the vast majority of their children have been brought up against unimaginable odds.  The life of Anthony Bowen illustrates what one man can do under what must have been crushing obstacles. He and other Black leaders of the YMCA  have made significant contributions toward the goal of passing on a better  life and a better community to the succeeding generations. They helped build community institutions that build up rather than tear down. These leaders brought hope, strength, purpose and responsibility to Black youth.  But, more importantly, they had a spirit  a great spirit. They were able to challenge and organize the positive and forward thinking people of their communities. YMCAs were built by the hard working people of great spirits who fought against impossible circumstances to build a better life  for their children and for future generations of their people.  It seems to me that our challenge today is to begin with 1978 to emphasize and support the positive forces of these communities  build on their strengths. Help those communities' institutions whose programs increase the capacity of the community residents to struggle against the evils that exist. We in the YMCA have a head start. We have YMCAs in over 140 Black communities. Some of these are strong; and others need strengthening.

SECOND, we need to reestablish relationships with the basic institutions in the Black community in this order  the Black family, the Black church and Black educational institutions. The historical development of the YMCA in Black communities was nurtured by leaders of these institutions.  THIRD, we need to reorient our goals, problem perspectives, strategies and style of work so that they are perceived by folk in Black communities as being theirs. Three critical elements to look for are: first, the YMCA  must be reaffirmed as a private, voluntary organization; and second, the YMCA goals for youth must be the same as those a family has for its children; and third, the YMCA must be identified with community uplift activities.  FOURTH, we need to relate the struggle of Black people to the struggle of other THIRD WORLD PEOPLES to overcome racism. Toward that end we need to develop transcultural models in YMCAs.  The obstacles we face are many. Anthony Bowen and other early leaders also faced many obtstacles. They did not have the resources we have  buildings and equipment, cadres of committed and trained staff and volunteer leaders, and most of all a legacy of producing leaders that can overcome obstacles.  We are an extension of a history of creating and building regardless of the difficulties. We must join hands with other forces who are determined to have a better community  a better city  a better state  a better country  a better world.

C. 1853  The YMCA movement  an Association for the spiritual, mental and physical development of young men  was begun in London, England, on June 6, 1944 by George Williams. The Movement spread very rapidly, coming to North America in 1851 in the City of Montreal, Canada, and a few weeks later to Boston, Massachusetts.  Two years later, 1853, Anthony Bowen, a Black employed as a clerk in the U. S. Patent Office in Washington, D. C., and a group of his friends organized the YMCA For Colored Men and Boys. This was the first YMCA established for Blacks anywhere in the world. The Anthony Bowen Branch YMCA, located at 1816 Twelfth Street, N.W., is still active and provides relevant community service in the District of Washington. The founders and leaders of this historical monument provide a classic example of self-help because the founding occurred more than ten years before the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation by Abraham Lincoln.  Today, we are privileged to have two descendants of Mr. Bowen with us: Arminus Hayne, his grandson; and Mrs. Ella P. Moran, his great granddaughter.  ABOUT THE LOGO on the front cover: The original design was created by Ernest Uno, executive of the West Oahu Branch of the Honolulu YMCA. Symbolically, it is _ meant to convey the strength, solidity and movement forward and upward that are characteristics of YMCAs serving black communities. The stylized hand forms a Y which cradles the YMCA triangle.

In the United States, there are 1,825 Member Associations that serve a constituency of over eight million people. Of that total, 139 are in Black communities.  The first YMCA in a Black community was established in 1853 by Anthony Bowen, who became its first president. The association was incorporated in 1892, and the present building at 1816 Twelfth Street, N.W. in Washington, D. C. was dedicated in 1912. Its name was changed to the Anthony Bowen Branch YMCA in 1972 in honor of its founder.  YMCAs represent one of the major private, voluntary institutions for Black people in the United States of America and in other countries. Although Black people may participate in any YMCA they choose, the YMCAs in Black communities represent one of the largest community-based institutions for Black people. Often referred to as Black YMCAs, these 139 units have a combined professional staff of over 750, more than 4,000 volunteer community leaders serving on boards and committees, considerable investments in facilities and equipment, and over 500,000 constituents. These local YMCAs have had a very significant impact on the lives of Black people. The history reveals that Black YMCA leaders have helped create numerous other organizations that have proven vital in the struggle of Black people to address their issues.  The struggle for civil and human rights in the YMCA has continued from its early beginnings. The YMCA was born in a time of turmoil in this country, and in a time when Black leaders had to create their own institutions because they could not belong to white institutions. Through the years Black leaders have had numerous bitter experiences of trying to desegregate the YMCA and to correct un-Christian behavior on the parts of white YMCA leaders. Although the separate YMCAs were created because there was no choice, and Black leaders felt that all Christian brothers and sisters should be as one, the facts indicate that these self-help institutions have provided a fertile ground for many Black leaders who challenged them to aim high and to aspire to impossible goals. Black YMCA leaders provided positive symbols for Black young people and helped these youngsters prepare themselves to enter a white world full of confidence in themselves and knowledgeable and proud of their racial heritage.  This anniversary year YMCA leaders have reflected on the great legacy that past leaders have bequeathed to them and to future generations. Contributions of Black leaders have been recognized; and the importance of the YMCA in Black communities has been noted. More importantly, commitments have been made to launch new efforts to address the issues and concerns of Black communities.","page_count":0,"record_type":"secondary","parent_id":"p16022coll416:904","first_viewer_type":"image","viewer_type":"image","child_index":77,"attachment":"892.jp2","document_type":"item","featured_collection_order":999,"date_added":"2018-11-14T00:00:00Z","date_added_sort":"2018-11-14T00:00:00Z","date_modified":"2018-11-14T00:00:00Z"},{"id":"p16022coll416:894","object":"https://cdm16022.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/getthumbnail/collection/p16022coll416/id/894","set_spec":"p16022coll416","collection_name":"Jesse Alexander Papers","collection_description":"Papers documenting the YMCA career of Jesse N.

As we celebrate and honor Anthony Bowen as the founder and president of the first YMCA for colored men and boys in Washington, D.C., in 1853, let us be ever mindful of the unfinished work and challenges that we continue to face in communities across this nation. Let us rededicate ourselves in the spirit of Mr. Bowen and go forh with new faith, vigor and determination to conquer new horizons with love and Christian commitment. The challenge to us is simply to devote ourselves to the development of moral, intellectual, leadership and spiritual qualities of our youth. Let us fully accept this challenge knowing the struggle and unrelenting opposition which may confront us.  I am grateful for the support of the National Board of the YMCAs, the outstanding leadership of James Plinton, Jr., and Everett Christmas in coordinating the 125th Anniversary celebration, to J. Rupert Picott, Executive Director of the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History, to Jesse Alexander for his dedicated staff support, and to the officers and members of BAN-WYS for their full support and commitment to a revival of the Anthony Bowen spirit.  Richard E. Barber, President BAN-WYS  JAMES O. PLINTON, JR.  I believe that every thinking person associated with the YMCA movement has appreciated the importance of this 125th Anniversary of the Black YMCA in the U.S.A. and Africa. I have hesitated in using the word celebration because I feel that this is the connotation we wanted to avoid.  It would have been easy for us to fall victim to the pleasant luxury of a dramatic but sterile playback of our predecessors struggles, rather than a less dramatic review of what we aspire to in the future in the light of past failures and victories.  We have started what we hope will be effective action toward the continuous development and growth of this highly important sector of our national and world organization. I use that in a broad plural sense because the hard-earned evolution of the Black YMCA in the tense confines of the struggling Black communities contributed considerable wisdom and motivation to the whole international YMCA Movement, as it struggles upwards in its own fight to prevail.  As Vice Chairman of the National Board of YMCAs, and as Chairman of the Anniversary Collaborative Committee, I am committed not only to keep this faith, but to propagate it. The role of the Black YMCA is of primary importance to the achievement of the objectives of the YMCA as a whole. The need that existed when I was 14 years of age remains essentially the same as the Black YMCA enters this new era commencing our 126th year. We must still struggle to persevere. It is mandatory, therefore, that we work with persistence and dedication to assure the perpetuation of this essential sector of our whole YMCA organization; and thereby, enhance the effectiveness of our national and international efforts to attain the goals of the YMCA movement.
